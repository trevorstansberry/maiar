# Content Examples

> **This file is optional.** Add product-specific content examples when this product's audience,
> format, or vocabulary differs meaningfully from the company-wide style in
> `context/company/content-examples.md`.
>
> Common reasons to add product-level examples:
> - This product targets a radically different audience (e.g., enterprise B2B vs. DTC consumer)
> - The content format differs (e.g., technical whitepapers vs. punchy social posts)
> - The vocabulary differs (e.g., clinical terminology vs. everyday language)
>
> Commands read `context/company/content-examples.md` first, then this file as a supplement.
> Product-level examples calibrate tone, format, and vocabulary for this specific audience.
