# Positioning

> **This file is optional.** It exists when this product has its own market positioning —
> its own category, message hierarchy, and competitive framing.
>
> If the company has one unified positioning that covers all products, use
> `context/company/positioning.md` instead. If both apply, the company file carries the
> umbrella narrative; this file carries the product-specific positioning.
>
> Populated by running `/brand-positioning`. Can also be filled in manually.
