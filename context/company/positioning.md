# Positioning (Company-Wide)

> **This file is optional.** It exists when the company has one unified market positioning —
> one way to describe the whole company across all products.
>
> If each product occupies a different market category with its own positioning, delete this file
> and use `context/products/[slug]/positioning.md` per product instead.
>
> If both apply (an umbrella brand position plus per-product positioning), keep this file for
> the company narrative and add product-level positioning files for each product.
>
> Populated by running `/brand-positioning`. Can also be filled in manually.
