# Content Examples

> Shared brand voice and style references. Add 3-5 examples of approved, high-quality content
> that represents the company's overall style — tone, structure, and quality bar.
>
> These are used as style references when generating new content.
> Run `/brand-research [your-website-url]` to auto-populate with examples found online.
>
> **Multi-product note:** If your products target radically different audiences (e.g., enterprise B2B
> and direct-to-consumer), add product-specific examples at `context/products/[slug]/content-examples.md`
> to calibrate format and vocabulary for that audience. Product-level examples supplement these.
