# /social

Create social media content optimized for the platform.

## Usage

```
/social [platform] [topic or brief]
```

**Examples:**
```

/social twitter thought leadership on AI in marketing
/social instagram product feature highlight
/social tiktok behind the scenes of our team
/social linkedin series on common [industry] mistakes (5 posts)
/social all-platforms our Q4 product launch
```

## What Happens

1. Reads brand-voice.md, channels.md (for active handles), and content-examples.md
2. Adapts format to the target platform (length, structure, hashtags, CTA style)
3. If "all-platforms": creates platform-specific versions for each active channel
4. Applies social-content and social-media-marketing skills

## Platform-Specific Formatting

**LinkedIn:** Up to 3,000 characters; line breaks for readability; minimal hashtags (3-5); text-first
**Twitter / X:** Under 280 characters (or thread); punchy; hashtags 1-2 or none
**Instagram:** 125-150 words; hashtag-heavy (10-15); visual description included; CTA to bio link
**TikTok:** Caption under 150 characters; hook-forward; trending audio suggestion
**Facebook:** 80-100 words sweet spot; CTA included; group-friendly framing if applicable
**Threads:** Conversational; can be standalone or thread; under 500 characters per post

## Output Includes

- Post copy (platform-formatted)
- Hashtag suggestions (platform-appropriate)
- Best posting time recommendation
- Visual content brief (what image/video to use with the post)
- Engagement prompt (question or CTA to drive comments)
- Variations (2-3 angle options when relevant)
