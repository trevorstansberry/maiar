# B2C Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**Byron Sharp — How Brands Grow**
Sharp's research-backed principles challenge conventional marketing wisdom: (1) Reach light buyers, not just heavy users. (2) Build mental availability through distinctive brand assets. (3) Physical availability matters as much as mental — make the product easy to find and buy. (4) Loyalty programs have modest effects; broad reach matters more. The "double jeopardy law" — smaller brands have fewer buyers AND those buyers buy less frequently.

**Donald Miller — Building a StoryBrand**
Every B2C customer is the hero of their own story. Your brand is not the hero — it's the guide. The SB7 framework: Character (customer) → Problem → Guide (your brand) → Plan → Call to Action → Avoid Failure → Achieve Success. Brands fail when they position themselves as the hero instead of empowering the customer to be the hero.


B2C marketing appeals to individuals making personal decisions — often emotional, identity-driven, or value-based choices rather than ROI calculations. Speed and volume matter. The buyer and user are usually the same person, and conversion windows are short.

**B2C's core truth:** People buy to feel something — to feel confident, excited, safe, stylish, smart, or part of something. Features enable that feeling, but emotion drives the decision.

## B2C vs. B2B Differences

| Dimension | B2C | B2B |
|---|---|---|
| Decision time | Seconds to days | Weeks to months |
| Decision-makers | Usually one | Multiple stakeholders |
| Price sensitivity | Higher | Lower (if ROI is clear) |
| Purchase driver | Emotion + identity | Logic + ROI |
| Volume | High | Lower |
| Content | Visual, emotional, fast | Educational, proof-based |
| Key channels | Social, search, influencer | LinkedIn, content, email |

## Consumer Psychology Fundamentals

Understanding how consumers decide drives everything in B2C:

- **Social proof:** Consumers follow others. Reviews, ratings, user counts, and testimonials are critical.
- **FOMO and scarcity:** Limited-time offers and social scarcity ("3 left in stock", "20 people viewing this") drive urgency.
- **Identity:** "This product is for someone like me" — aspirational identity association.
- **Reciprocity:** Free samples, generous content, or unexpected gifts create obligation to buy.
- **Anchoring:** Show the original price before the sale price; introduce premium tier first.
- **Ease:** Friction reduction (1-click purchase, saved payment info) directly lifts conversion.

## B2C Channel Strategy

### High-Volume Acquisition Channels

**Paid Social (Meta, TikTok, Snapchat):**
- Best for demand creation — show product to people who didn't know they needed it
- Creative is everything: test 3-5+ creatives weekly; audience burns out fast
- UGC (user-generated content) consistently outperforms polished brand creative
- Video ads outperform static 3-5× for awareness
- Retarget website visitors within 24-48 hours while intent is fresh

**Paid Search (Google):**
- Best for demand capture — intercept people already searching for what you sell
- Shopping ads (Google Shopping) are essential for physical products
- Brand protection: always bid on your own brand terms

**Organic Social:**
- Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest (visual products)
- Focus on entertainment + education, not promotion
- Algorithm rewards consistency and engagement over perfection

**Email & SMS:**
- Most reliable owned channel for direct revenue
- SMS has 98% open rate but must be used sparingly — high churn if overused
- Abandoned cart sequences are highest-ROI automation for e-commerce

**Influencer:**
- Nano and micro influencers drive conversion; macro drives awareness
- UGC rights are valuable beyond the post itself — repurpose as ad creative

### DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) Specifics

**Owned channels:**
- Website + Shopify store with conversion-optimized UX
- Email list as the primary retention channel
- Social media for community and product discovery

**DTC economics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): must be < 1/3 of LTV
- Contribution margin: Revenue - variable costs (COGS + shipping + returns + payment processing)
- Payback period: Time to recover CAC; ideal < 90 days

**DTC acquisition stack:**
Meta Ads + Google Shopping + TikTok Ads → Email/SMS capture → Repeat purchase sequences

## Loyalty Programs

Loyalty programs work when they reward behavior you want to reinforce and deliver perceived value that exceeds the cost.

**Program Types:**
- **Points-based:** Earn points per dollar spent → redeem for discounts or products
- **Tiered:** Silver / Gold / Platinum — status motivates spending to reach next level
- **Paid membership:** VIP club with exclusive benefits (Amazon Prime model)
- **Value-based:** Rewards tied to brand values (e.g., Patagonia's repair program)

**What makes loyalty programs work:**
- Easy to understand (simple point math)
- Attainable rewards (not buried in small print)
- Emotional benefits beyond discounts (early access, exclusive products, community)
- Progress visibility (show how close they are to the next reward)

## Brand and Emotional Marketing

B2C brands win on identity and community, not just product features.

**Building brand in B2C:**
- Consistent visual identity at every touchpoint
- Brand personality that the target customer wants to be associated with
- Community and belonging (customers who buy feel part of something)
- Cause alignment (many B2C audiences care about the brand's values)
- Memorable, repeatable brand experiences (packaging, unboxing, post-purchase)

## B2C Funnel Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| ROAS | Revenue / Ad spend — target 3-5× |
| CAC | Total marketing spend / New customers acquired |
| LTV | Average purchase value × Purchase frequency × Avg customer lifespan |
| Conversion rate | % of visitors who purchase |
| Cart abandonment rate | % of cart adds that don't purchase (norm: 65-75%) |
| Email open rate | Industry average 20-35% |
| Repeat purchase rate | % of customers who buy again |
| Net Promoter Score | Customer satisfaction proxy |

## Common Mistakes

- Scaling paid before fixing conversion rate (pouring money into a leaky funnel)
- Relying only on paid channels (no owned audience means no resilience)
- No post-purchase experience (first purchase profit is low; lifetime value is everything)
- Treating all customers the same (high LTV customers deserve different treatment)
- Ignoring reviews and social proof until they need them
