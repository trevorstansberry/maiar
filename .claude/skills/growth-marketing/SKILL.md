description: "Use when designing growth experiments, building growth loops, running the AARRR framework, designing product-led growth strategies, identifying growth levers, or creating a systematic experimentation process. Also use when the user says "growth marketing", "growth hacking", "growth experiments", "growth loops", "AARRR", "viral coefficient", "product-led growth", "PLG", "growth framework", "experimentation", or "activation rate". Applies Sean Ellis's growth hacking methodology, Brian Balfour's Reforge growth model, and Andrew Chen's viral loop framework."

# Growth Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Growth marketing is systematic, cross-functional marketing that treats customer acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue as one connected system — and runs experiments to improve every stage. It's not a department or a channel; it's a way of operating.

**Growth vs. traditional marketing:**
- Traditional: Plan campaigns, execute, measure
- Growth: Hypothesize, test, measure, iterate — across the entire user journey

## The AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)

| Stage | Question | Key Metrics |
|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition** | How do people find us? | CAC, traffic by channel, new signups |
| **Activation** | Do they have their first "aha" moment? | Activation rate, time to value |
| **Retention** | Do they keep coming back? | Churn rate, DAU/MAU, cohort retention |
| **Revenue** | Do they pay us? | ARPU, MRR, LTV, expansion revenue |
| **Referral** | Do they tell others? | Viral coefficient (K-factor), referral rate |

**The lever that matters most varies by stage.** Early-stage: focus on activation. Mid-stage: focus on retention. Scale-stage: focus on acquisition efficiency.

## Growth Loop Architecture

Growth loops are self-reinforcing systems where user actions create more users or more revenue.

**Examples:**

**Content loop:** User creates content → Content gets discovered → Discovery brings new users → New users create more content

**Viral loop:** User invites team member → Team member signs up → Team member invites their team

**SEO loop:** Users generate reviews/UGC → Content gets indexed → Organic traffic → More users → More UGC

**Referral loop:** Happy customer shares referral link → New customer signs up → Both get reward → Become happy customers → repeat

**How to design a growth loop:**
1. Identify the core user action that creates value
2. Find the output of that action (content, network, data, referrals)
3. Design a system that converts that output into more users or usage

## Experimentation Framework

### Hypothesis Format
"We believe [change/action] for [who] will result in [outcome] because [reason]. We will know this worked when [measurable signal]."

### Experiment Prioritization (ICE Score)
Rate each experiment idea on a 1-10 scale:
- **Impact:** How much will this move the needle if it works?
- **Confidence:** How confident are we this will work?
- **Ease:** How easy is this to test?

ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

### Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE)
Always ask: "What's the smallest test that would validate this hypothesis?"
- Don't build the full feature — mock it first
- Don't redesign the page — test a single element
- Don't launch a campaign — test the message with a small audience

### Statistical Validity
- Most experiments need 100-200 conversions per variant to be significant
- Run tests for at least 1-2 full business weeks (avoid day-of-week bias)
- Use 95% confidence threshold before declaring a winner
- Don't peek early — looking at results before completion inflates false positives

## Product-Led Growth (PLG)

PLG is a growth strategy where the product itself is the primary acquisition and expansion engine.

**PLG Patterns:**
- **Freemium:** Free tier drives acquisition → upgrade conversion
- **Free trial:** Time-limited access → conversion pressure
- **Virality:** Users invite others as part of core workflow (Slack, Figma, Calendly)
- **Network effects:** Value increases with more users (Notion, Linear)
- **Usage-based expansion:** Low entry point; usage drives revenue growth

**Activation as the growth lever in PLG:**
Define your "aha moment" — the moment a new user realizes the product's value — and ruthlessly remove everything between signup and that moment.

### PLG Funnel Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Signup rate | % of visitors who sign up |
| Activation rate | % of signups who reach aha moment |
| Time to activate | How long it takes to reach aha moment |
| PQL rate | % of activated users who become Product Qualified Leads |
| PQL → Paid conversion | % of PQLs who convert to paying |
| Expansion rate | % of customers who expand usage/tier |

## Retention Growth Levers

Retention is the multiplier for all acquisition:
- Fix retention before scaling acquisition (pouring water into a leaky bucket)
- Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention are key milestones — identify where you lose people
- Cohort analysis reveals whether retention is improving over time

**Retention tactics by lever:**
- Improve onboarding → increase activation → improve Day 7 retention
- Add engagement triggers → habit formation → improve Day 30 retention
- Build community → social belonging → improve long-term retention
- Add integrations → stickiness → reduce churn
- Improve product → NPS → reduce churn + increase referrals

## Referral / Viral Growth

**Viral coefficient (K-factor) = Invites sent per user × Conversion rate of invites**
- K > 1: Exponential growth (rare)
- K = 0.5-1: Significant viral contribution
- K < 0.1: Viral is not a meaningful growth driver yet

**Making referral work:**
- The product must be good enough that users want to share
- Reduce friction to sharing (one click, pre-written message)
- Give the referrer a reason to share (reward, recognition, altruism)
- Give the referred a reason to sign up (incentive, social proof from sender)
