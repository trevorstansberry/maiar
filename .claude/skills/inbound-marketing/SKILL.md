# Inbound Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Inbound marketing earns attention by creating content and experiences people actively seek out — the opposite of interrupting them. The goal is to attract the right people, engage them with value, and convert them into customers and advocates.

**The Inbound Flywheel:** Attract → Engage → Delight → (Advocate → Attract again)

## Attract Stage

### SEO-Led Attraction
- Build topical authority through pillar pages + cluster content
- Target bottom-of-funnel keywords first (commercial/transactional intent), then expand to informational
- Create the best resource on each topic, not just the longest one
- Use SERP analysis: match format (list, guide, comparison) to what ranks

### Content-Led Attraction
- Define 2-3 content pillars aligned to your ICP's problems
- Map content to buyer journey stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Create content worth linking to: original research, definitive guides, free tools, templates

### Lead Magnets (Top of Funnel)
Best performers by category:
- **SaaS/Tech:** Free tools, ROI calculators, free tier, templates
- **B2B services:** Assessments, audits, research reports, benchmarks
- **E-commerce/B2C:** Discount codes, quizzes, free samples, style guides
- **Education:** Mini-courses, checklists, playbooks

Lead magnet formula: Solve one specific problem for one specific person in the shortest possible time.

## Engage Stage

### Lead Nurture Principles
- Segment by source, intent signal, and persona — never send the same sequence to everyone
- Deliver value 2-3x before making an ask
- Use behavioral triggers (page visits, content downloads, email clicks) to accelerate qualified leads
- Retarget content consumers with the next logical step in their journey

### Website Conversion Points
- Homepage: One primary CTA — usually "Start free trial" or "Book a demo"
- Blog posts: Contextual CTAs related to the post topic (not generic newsletter signup)
- Pricing page: Trust signals + social proof above the fold; FAQ for objection handling below
- High-intent pages: Live chat or chatbot for immediate engagement

## Delight Stage

### Turning Customers Into Advocates
- Identify happy customers (NPS 9-10) within 60-90 days of onboarding
- Ask for case studies, G2/Capterra reviews, and referrals at peak satisfaction moments
- Create exclusive content, community, or events for customers only
- Build in-product social sharing and referral mechanics

## Inbound Content Calendar Framework

**Monthly publishing minimum by company stage:**
- Early stage: 2-4 blog posts/month + 1 lead magnet/quarter
- Growth stage: 4-8 blog posts/month + 2 lead magnets/quarter
- Scale stage: 8-16 blog posts/month + systematic pillar/cluster buildout

**Content mix:**
- 40% SEO-targeted (search demand exists)
- 30% audience-requested (answers questions your ICP asks)
- 20% thought leadership (builds authority and backlinks)
- 10% conversion-focused (product comparisons, use cases)

## Inbound Metrics

| Stage | Metric |
|---|---|
| Attract | Organic sessions, keyword rankings, backlinks earned |
| Engage | Lead conversion rate, email open/click rates, demo bookings |
| Delight | NPS, customer retention rate, referral rate |
| Flywheel | % of pipeline from inbound, CAC from organic vs. paid |

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with brand awareness instead of bottom-of-funnel content
- Creating content without distribution plans (publish and pray)
- Treating all leads the same regardless of intent signals
- Measuring traffic instead of pipeline contribution
- No clear next step after someone downloads a lead magnet
