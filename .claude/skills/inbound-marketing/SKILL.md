# Inbound Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**HubSpot / Dharmesh Shah — The Inbound Methodology**
The original inbound framework: Stop interrupting. Start helping. The Attract-Engage-Delight flywheel replaced the traditional funnel because customers who are delighted become promoters who fuel the Attract stage for new prospects. Every piece of content should answer a question a prospect is already asking.

**Marcus Sheridan — They Ask You Answer**
The most powerful inbound strategy: answer every question your customers ask, even the uncomfortable ones (price, problems, comparisons, negatives, reviews). Companies that answer honestly become the trusted authority in their category. Sheridan calls this "The Big 5": pricing/cost, problems, comparisons, reviews, and best-of lists.


Inbound marketing earns attention by creating content and experiences people actively seek out — the opposite of interrupting them. The goal is to attract the right people, engage them with value, and convert them into customers and advocates.

**The Inbound Flywheel:** Attract → Engage → Delight → (Advocate → Attract again)

## Attract Stage

### SEO-Led Attraction
- Build topical authority through pillar pages + cluster content
- Target bottom-of-funnel keywords first (commercial/transactional intent), then expand to informational
- Create the best resource on each topic, not just the longest one
- Use SERP analysis: match format (list, guide, comparison) to what ranks

### Content-Led Attraction
- Define 2-3 content pillars aligned to your ICP's problems
- Map content to buyer journey stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Create content worth linking to: original research, definitive guides, free tools, templates

### Lead Magnets (Top of Funnel)
Best performers by category:
- **SaaS/Tech:** Free tools, ROI calculators, free tier, templates
- **B2B services:** Assessments, audits, research reports, benchmarks
- **E-commerce/B2C:** Discount codes, quizzes, free samples, style guides
- **Education:** Mini-courses, checklists, playbooks

Lead magnet formula: Solve one specific problem for one specific person in the shortest possible time.

## Engage Stage

### Lead Nurture Principles
- Segment by source, intent signal, and persona — never send the same sequence to everyone
- Deliver value 2-3x before making an ask
- Use behavioral triggers (page visits, content downloads, email clicks) to accelerate qualified leads
- Retarget content consumers with the next logical step in their journey

### Website Conversion Points
- Homepage: One primary CTA — usually "Start free trial" or "Book a demo"
- Blog posts: Contextual CTAs related to the post topic (not generic newsletter signup)
- Pricing page: Trust signals + social proof above the fold; FAQ for objection handling below
- High-intent pages: Live chat or chatbot for immediate engagement

## Delight Stage

### Turning Customers Into Advocates
- Identify happy customers (NPS 9-10) within 60-90 days of onboarding
- Ask for case studies, G2/Capterra reviews, and referrals at peak satisfaction moments
- Create exclusive content, community, or events for customers only
- Build in-product social sharing and referral mechanics

## Inbound Content Calendar Framework

**Monthly publishing minimum by company stage:**
- Early stage: 2-4 blog posts/month + 1 lead magnet/quarter
- Growth stage: 4-8 blog posts/month + 2 lead magnets/quarter
- Scale stage: 8-16 blog posts/month + systematic pillar/cluster buildout

**Content mix:**
- 40% SEO-targeted (search demand exists)
- 30% audience-requested (answers questions your ICP asks)
- 20% thought leadership (builds authority and backlinks)
- 10% conversion-focused (product comparisons, use cases)

## Inbound Metrics

| Stage | Metric |
|---|---|
| Attract | Organic sessions, keyword rankings, backlinks earned |
| Engage | Lead conversion rate, email open/click rates, demo bookings |
| Delight | NPS, customer retention rate, referral rate |
| Flywheel | % of pipeline from inbound, CAC from organic vs. paid |

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with brand awareness instead of bottom-of-funnel content
- Creating content without distribution plans (publish and pray)
- Treating all leads the same regardless of intent signals
- Measuring traffic instead of pipeline contribution
- No clear next step after someone downloads a lead magnet
