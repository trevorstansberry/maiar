# Events & Experiential Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Events create experiences that no other marketing channel can replicate — they build relationships, accelerate trust, and drive decisions in compressed timeframes. The best events leave attendees with a feeling, not just information.

**ROI mindset:** Events are expensive. Every decision (venue, format, speakers) should trace back to a specific business outcome: pipeline generated, customers retained, brand positioned.

## Event Types & When to Use Them

| Event Type | Best For | Typical Goals |
|---|---|---|
| Webinar / Virtual event | Lead gen, education, thought leadership | Leads, engagement, nurture |
| User conference | Customer retention, upsell, community | NRR, advocacy, LTV |
| Industry conference (own) | Thought leadership, community building | Brand authority, leads |
| Trade show / conference (sponsor) | Awareness, lead gen at scale | Brand, leads, meetings |
| Field events / roundtables | Pipeline acceleration, account engagement | Pipeline, relationships |
| Experiential activation | Brand awareness, PR, word-of-mouth | Impressions, earned media |
| Executive dinners / VIP events | ABM, enterprise pipeline | Enterprise pipeline |

## Event Strategy Framework

### Before You Plan, Answer These Questions
1. Who is the target attendee? (Specific persona, not "anyone in our space")
2. What is the one outcome we're optimizing for?
3. What action do we want attendees to take next?
4. How will we measure success?
5. What's the budget and how does ROI break even?

### The Event Value Exchange
Attendees give you their time and attention. In return, they expect:
- Actionable insights they can use immediately
- Networking with relevant peers
- Access to something they can't get elsewhere
- Entertainment or experience

## Webinar / Virtual Event Playbook

### Pre-Event (4-6 weeks out)
- Choose topic that solves a specific, timely problem for target persona
- Secure 1-2 credible speakers (internal expert + external guest for reach)
- Build registration page with clear promise: "You'll leave knowing how to X"
- Promotion sequence: 4 emails over 4 weeks to list + social + paid
- Reminder sequence: 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour before

### During the Event
- Start 5 minutes late (people are joining)
- Open with the payoff: tell them what they'll leave with
- Run 45-60 minutes max; attention drops after 45
- Use polls, Q&A, and chat to drive engagement
- Save 10-15 minutes for live Q&A

### Post-Event (0-72 hours)
- Send recording + resources within 24 hours
- Segment attendees vs. no-shows — different follow-up sequences
- Sales follow-up for engaged attendees (asked questions, stayed full duration)
- Repurpose: clip key moments for social, turn into blog post

## Trade Show / Conference Strategy

### Pre-Show (8-12 weeks out)
- Set target: X qualified meetings, X new contacts, X pipeline influenced
- Book meetings before the show (outreach to attendees list if available)
- Design booth around one clear conversation starter, not a product catalog
- Prepare the team: 1-sentence pitch, qualifying questions, next step offer

### At the Show
- Lead with a question, not a pitch: "What's your biggest challenge with X?"
- Qualify fast: BANT or MEDDIC-light in 5 minutes
- Capture contact info with context (what they care about)
- Host a side event (dinner, breakfast, happy hour) for deeper relationship building

### Post-Show (0-7 days)
- Follow up within 24-48 hours while memory is fresh
- Personalize to the conversation: "You mentioned X — here's how we've helped..."
- Route to appropriate nurture or sales sequence based on qualification

## Experiential Activation Playbook

Experiential = creating a physical or sensory experience tied to your brand story.

**Principles:**
- The experience IS the message — what feeling do you want people to walk away with?
- Design for shareability — if it's not photogenic or story-worthy, it won't earn media
- Create an emotion: surprise, delight, challenge, inspiration
- Always have a digital bridge: QR code, hashtag, or digital CTA to capture leads

**Activation ideation questions:**
- What does our brand believe that most brands wouldn't do?
- What unexpected context could make our product message land?
- What would make a stranger stop and pull out their phone?

## Budget Framework

| Budget Tier | Event Type | Expected ROI Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| < $5K | Webinar, virtual event | 30-60 days |
| $5K-$25K | Field event, small conference sponsorship | 60-120 days |
| $25K-$100K | Owned conference, major trade show | 90-180 days |
| $100K+ | Large conference, experiential activation | 6-18 months |

## Event Metrics
