# Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

## Core Philosophy

ABM flips the traditional marketing funnel. Instead of casting wide and filtering down, you start with a defined list of target accounts and build campaigns specifically for them. Quality over quantity — a smaller set of highly relevant accounts engaged more deeply.

**ABM's core promise:** Higher win rates, shorter sales cycles, and larger deal sizes in return for more focused investment per account.

## ABM Tiers

| Tier | Scale | Approach | Investment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1:1 (Strategic ABM) | 5-50 accounts | Fully custom campaigns per account | Highest |
| 1:Few (ABM Lite) | 50-500 accounts | Campaigns for clusters of similar accounts | Medium |
| 1:Many (Programmatic ABM) | 500-5,000+ accounts | Targeted but scalable campaigns | Lower per account |

Most companies should start with 1:Few — enough personalization to matter, scalable enough to run.

## Account Selection

### Building Your Target Account List

**Criteria to score accounts:**
- **Fit:** Company size, industry, tech stack, geography, budget indicators
- **Intent:** Behavioral signals — researching your category, visiting your site, G2 profile views
- **Relationship:** Existing connection, past conversations, references in your network
- **Timing:** Funding round, leadership change, expansion announcement, contract renewal period

**Sources:**
- CRM data: Closed-won accounts (clone them)
- Intent data: Bombora, 6sense, G2 Buyer Intent, Demandbase
- Technographic data: BuiltWith, HG Insights (who uses competitor tech)
- Firmographic data: Apollo, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**ABM Target Account List (TAL) format:**
| Account | Tier | Industry | Size | Intent Signals | Owner (AE) | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Stakeholder Mapping per Account
For each target account, map:
- Economic buyer (title + LinkedIn URL)
- Champion (most likely internal advocate)
- End users
- Blockers and influencers

## ABM Campaign Playbooks

### 1:1 (Strategic ABM) Campaign Elements
- Dedicated microsite or landing page with account name/logo
- Custom research report or industry analysis tailored to their situation
- Personalized executive outreach (CEO/CMO to CEO/CMO)
- Bespoke event invitation (private dinner, exclusive briefing)
- Tailored sales deck, ROI model, and case studies from their industry
- LinkedIn engagement with their leadership before and during campaign

### 1:Few Campaign Playbook
Group accounts by shared characteristic (same industry vertical, same tech stack, same use case):

1. **Account research:** 30-minute research pass per account on key challenges, recent news
2. **Segment content:** Adapt existing assets to the vertical (change examples, stats, copy)
3. **Personalized ads:** LinkedIn/display targeted to account list with vertical-specific creative
4. **Email sequence:** Personalized opening line + segment-relevant case study
5. **SDR outreach:** Triggered when account shows engagement signal
6. **Sales handoff:** Warm intro with context on what the account has engaged with

### 1:Many Playbook
- Build segment-level campaigns (industry or persona clusters)
- Use intent data to trigger campaign entry
- Automated email sequences with moderate personalization
- LinkedIn matched audience campaigns to account list
- Retargeting with account-specific or segment-specific messaging
- SDR engagement triggered by engagement score threshold

## ABM Infrastructure

### Technology Stack
- **CRM:** Salesforce, HubSpot — must have clean account data
- **ABM Platform:** 6sense, Demandbase, Terminus, Rollworks
- **Intent Data:** Bombora, G2 Buyer Intent
- **Engagement Tracking:** Visitor identification (Clearbit Reveal, Leadfeeder)
- **Ads:** LinkedIn Campaign Manager (account list matching), Google Customer Match
- **Sales Engagement:** Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo

### Account Scoring
Build an engagement score per account:
- Website visit: +5 points
- Pricing page visit: +15 points
- Content download: +10 points
- Email click: +5 points
- LinkedIn ad click: +5 points
- Demo request: +50 points
- SDR meeting: +30 points

When score crosses threshold → trigger SDR outreach or sales alert.

## Sales & Marketing Alignment

ABM only works when sales and marketing operate as one team on target accounts.

### Joint Responsibilities
| Marketing | Shared | Sales |
|---|---|---|
| Account selection criteria | TAL management | Account intelligence |
| Campaign design | Account scoring | Outreach timing |
| Content creation | Messaging | Discovery and demos |
| Paid and digital engagement | Pipeline reviews | Relationship building |

### ABM Operating Rhythm
- **Weekly:** Review engagement signals and active account activity
- **Monthly:** Pipeline review — which accounts are in late stage, what do they need?
- **Quarterly:** Refresh TAL — graduate accounts that closed/lost, add new targets

## ABM Metrics

Traditional marketing metrics don't apply to ABM. Use:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Account engagement rate | % of TAL engaged in last 30 days |
| Pipeline from TAL | Revenue in pipeline from target accounts |
| % of pipeline from TAL | ABM channel contribution to total pipeline |
| Account win rate | Win rate on TAL vs. non-TAL |
| Average deal size (TAL) | Deal quality from ABM |
| Sales cycle length (TAL) | Does ABM accelerate the cycle? |
| Account coverage | % of buying committee contacted |

## Common Mistakes

- Targeting too many accounts (dilutes resources and personalization)
- Sales not bought in — ABM without sales alignment is just targeted marketing
- No intent data — targeting by fit alone misses timing
- Measuring leads instead of accounts (a single account can generate 10 leads)
- Expecting immediate pipeline — ABM is a 6-18 month investment
