# Cause Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Cause marketing is a collaborative effort between a business and a nonprofit or social cause that benefits both. Done authentically, it builds brand affinity, attracts mission-aligned customers, and creates genuine impact. Done cynically, it's "cause-washing" — and audiences increasingly call it out.

**The authenticity test:** Would your founder do this cause work even if no one was watching or if it didn't benefit the brand? If no, reconsider.


## Expert Foundations

**Cone Communications — Cause Marketing Research**
Cone's annual research (backed by 30+ years of data): 87% of consumers will purchase a product because a company advocated for an issue they cared about. 76% will refuse to purchase from a company that takes a stand on an issue they disagree with. The lesson: cause marketing creates both upside and risk. The only wrong answer is to align inauthentically — consumers are acutely sensitive to cause-washing.

**Simon Sinek — Start With Why**
Sinek's insight applied to cause marketing: causes work when they connect to the brand's core "why" — not when they're added on for PR value. Patagonia's environmentalism isn't a campaign; it's the origin story of the company. That authenticity is unimpeachable because it's structural, not cosmetic.

### The Authenticity Test

Before any cause association, ask:
1. **Proximity:** Is this cause close to your business or just opportunistic? (Patagonia + environment = close; fast fashion brand + environment = suspicious)
2. **Consistency:** Have you been involved in this cause for years, or just during the news cycle?
3. **Sacrifice:** Are you willing to lose business or take a political stance to support this cause?
4. **Internal:** Does your company actually operate by these values? (Supply chain, employee treatment, etc.)

If you can't answer yes to all four, cause-washing risk is high.

### Cause-Brand Alignment Matrix

| Alignment Type | Example | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Intrinsic (cause = brand DNA) | Patagonia + environment; TOMS + poverty | Low — customers expect it, company lives it |
| Adjacent (cause relates to audience) | Dove + body positivity (audience = women) | Medium — credible if sustained |
| Campaign (cause timed to launch) | Brand + trending social cause | High — perceived as opportunistic |
| Unrelated (cause = no connection) | Energy company + childhood literacy | Very high — incoherent |

### Cause Campaign Structures

**1. Purchase-triggered donation (Product Red, TOMS 1:1)**
A portion of each sale goes to the cause. Clear, simple, measurable.
- Best for: Consumer brands with high volume transactions
- Risk: Donation size scrutinized by consumers ("1% of profits" vs. "10% to the cause")

**2. Co-branded campaign**
Brand partners with an NGO or charity for joint campaigns and shared visibility.
- Best for: Building credibility through association
- Risk: If partner has a crisis, it reflects on you

**3. Advocacy and stance-taking**
Brand publicly supports a cause, position, or policy. No transaction required.
- Best for: Brands with strongly aligned audiences (Nike/Colin Kaepernick)
- Risk: Highest risk — polarizes if not aligned with audience values

**4. Employee and community programs**
Internal giving, volunteer programs, matching donations.
- Best for: B2B, employer branding, authenticity signals
- Risk: Lowest — rarely backfires, but also rarely generates external attention

### Measurement

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Brand sentiment shift | Net positive/negative change in brand perception |
| Earned media value | Coverage from cause initiative |
| Social share of voice | % of category conversation including your brand + cause |
| Purchase intent lift | Before/after survey: "I'm more likely to buy" |
| Donation / program outcomes | Actual impact metrics for the cause |

## Cause Marketing Models

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Percentage of sales | Donate X% of revenue to a cause | TOMS "One for One" |
| Purchase trigger | Donate when a customer buys a specific product | Buy one, plant a tree |
| Awareness campaign | Use platform to raise awareness (not just money) | Brand posts on social issues |
| Co-branded campaign | Partner with nonprofit on joint campaign | Chase + Make-A-Wish |
| Employee matching | Match employee donations to any nonprofit | Many tech companies |
| Cause-linked product | Product proceeds go entirely to cause | (RED) line with multiple brands |
| Pro bono / in-kind | Donate services or products to nonprofit partners | Tech for social good |
| Mission-led business | Cause is core to business model | Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's |

## Selecting the Right Cause

**Alignment test:**
1. Does the cause connect to your brand's purpose or values?
2. Does your audience care about this cause?
3. Can you make a credible impact (not just write a check)?
4. Is this cause your brand can authentically own — or is it one every brand in your category claims?
5. Is the nonprofit partner reputable and effective?

**Categories by audience fit:**
- Tech/SaaS: Education access, digital equity, STEM programs
- Health/wellness brands: Mental health, food access, environment
- B2C consumer: Local community, environment, social justice
- B2B enterprise: Economic development, education, workforce

**What to avoid:**
- Causes associated with political controversy (unless that's part of your brand identity)
- Causes that feel completely disconnected from your business
- Performative support: Posting a black square or adding a filter for 1 day

## Campaign Design

### Purpose-Driven Brand Narrative
Integrate cause commitment into brand story, not as an add-on but as a pillar:
- "Why we were founded" story that connects to the cause
- Ongoing commitment with measurable outcomes
- Transparent reporting on impact

### Campaign Mechanics
- Clear donation/impact mechanic (what happens when you buy/share/participate?)
- Specific, quantifiable goal ("We're raising $100,000 by [date]")
- Progress updates that show real movement toward goal
- Stories from the beneficiary (real people, not vague "communities helped")
- Partner nonprofit validation and co-promotion

### Communication Principles
- Lead with the impact, not the brand
- Be specific about what the money does (feeds 50 families, plants 1,000 trees)
- Show your work: how much was donated, who received it, what it accomplished
- Avoid language that makes the brand the hero; the cause beneficiaries are the hero
- Disclose all terms: what % goes to charity, any caps on donations

## Authenticity vs. Cause-Washing

**Authentic signals:**
- Long-term commitment (not one campaign per year)
- Leadership personally connected to the cause
- Employees involved and supportive
- Willingness to act even when it's costly or controversial
- Transparency about the limits of the program

**Cause-washing red flags:**
- Cause alignment only during "cause awareness months" with no year-round commitment
- Vague language ("supporting our community") with no specifics
- Donation amounts that are a rounding error vs. company revenue
- Cause chosen by marketing team based on brand safety, not genuine values
- No third-party verification or reporting

## Measurement

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Dollars raised / donated | Direct impact contribution |
| Social reach / earned media | Awareness amplification |
| Brand sentiment lift | Perception change |
| Campaign conversion rate | Business impact |
| Partner satisfaction | Relationship quality |
| Employee engagement | Internal culture impact |
| Customer acquisition from cause | Revenue attributed to cause alignment |

## Legal Considerations

- **Charitable solicitation laws:** Most states require registration if you're soliciting donations on behalf of a charity
- **FTC guidelines:** Disclosures required for cause-related marketing claims
- **Contract with nonprofit:** Define donation caps, reporting requirements, approval rights, term
- **Accounting:** Cause marketing donations may or may not be tax-deductible depending on structure
