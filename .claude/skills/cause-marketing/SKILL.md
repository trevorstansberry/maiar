# Cause Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Cause marketing is a collaborative effort between a business and a nonprofit or social cause that benefits both. Done authentically, it builds brand affinity, attracts mission-aligned customers, and creates genuine impact. Done cynically, it's "cause-washing" — and audiences increasingly call it out.

**The authenticity test:** Would your founder do this cause work even if no one was watching or if it didn't benefit the brand? If no, reconsider.

## Cause Marketing Models

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Percentage of sales | Donate X% of revenue to a cause | TOMS "One for One" |
| Purchase trigger | Donate when a customer buys a specific product | Buy one, plant a tree |
| Awareness campaign | Use platform to raise awareness (not just money) | Brand posts on social issues |
| Co-branded campaign | Partner with nonprofit on joint campaign | Chase + Make-A-Wish |
| Employee matching | Match employee donations to any nonprofit | Many tech companies |
| Cause-linked product | Product proceeds go entirely to cause | (RED) line with multiple brands |
| Pro bono / in-kind | Donate services or products to nonprofit partners | Tech for social good |
| Mission-led business | Cause is core to business model | Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's |

## Selecting the Right Cause

**Alignment test:**
1. Does the cause connect to your brand's purpose or values?
2. Does your audience care about this cause?
3. Can you make a credible impact (not just write a check)?
4. Is this cause your brand can authentically own — or is it one every brand in your category claims?
5. Is the nonprofit partner reputable and effective?

**Categories by audience fit:**
- Tech/SaaS: Education access, digital equity, STEM programs
- Health/wellness brands: Mental health, food access, environment
- B2C consumer: Local community, environment, social justice
- B2B enterprise: Economic development, education, workforce

**What to avoid:**
- Causes associated with political controversy (unless that's part of your brand identity)
- Causes that feel completely disconnected from your business
- Performative support: Posting a black square or adding a filter for 1 day

## Campaign Design

### Purpose-Driven Brand Narrative
Integrate cause commitment into brand story, not as an add-on but as a pillar:
- "Why we were founded" story that connects to the cause
- Ongoing commitment with measurable outcomes
- Transparent reporting on impact

### Campaign Mechanics
- Clear donation/impact mechanic (what happens when you buy/share/participate?)
- Specific, quantifiable goal ("We're raising $100,000 by [date]")
- Progress updates that show real movement toward goal
- Stories from the beneficiary (real people, not vague "communities helped")
- Partner nonprofit validation and co-promotion

### Communication Principles
- Lead with the impact, not the brand
- Be specific about what the money does (feeds 50 families, plants 1,000 trees)
- Show your work: how much was donated, who received it, what it accomplished
- Avoid language that makes the brand the hero; the cause beneficiaries are the hero
- Disclose all terms: what % goes to charity, any caps on donations

## Authenticity vs. Cause-Washing

**Authentic signals:**
- Long-term commitment (not one campaign per year)
- Leadership personally connected to the cause
- Employees involved and supportive
- Willingness to act even when it's costly or controversial
- Transparency about the limits of the program

**Cause-washing red flags:**
- Cause alignment only during "cause awareness months" with no year-round commitment
- Vague language ("supporting our community") with no specifics
- Donation amounts that are a rounding error vs. company revenue
- Cause chosen by marketing team based on brand safety, not genuine values
- No third-party verification or reporting

## Measurement

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Dollars raised / donated | Direct impact contribution |
| Social reach / earned media | Awareness amplification |
| Brand sentiment lift | Perception change |
| Campaign conversion rate | Business impact |
| Partner satisfaction | Relationship quality |
| Employee engagement | Internal culture impact |
| Customer acquisition from cause | Revenue attributed to cause alignment |

## Legal Considerations

- **Charitable solicitation laws:** Most states require registration if you're soliciting donations on behalf of a charity
- **FTC guidelines:** Disclosures required for cause-related marketing claims
- **Contract with nonprofit:** Define donation caps, reporting requirements, approval rights, term
- **Accounting:** Cause marketing donations may or may not be tax-deductible depending on structure
