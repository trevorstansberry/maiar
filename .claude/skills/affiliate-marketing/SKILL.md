# Affiliate Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Affiliate marketing is performance-based distribution: others promote your product in exchange for a commission on results. Done well, it's one of the highest-ROI channels because you only pay for outcomes. Done poorly, it attracts low-quality traffic and brand-damaging promotions.

**The affiliate opportunity:** Your best affiliates are people who already use and love your product, have an audience that matches your ICP, and have a credible platform in your category.

## Affiliate Program Types

| Type | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Content/SEO affiliates | Review, comparison, or "best of" content that ranks in search | SaaS, e-commerce |
| Coupon/deal sites | Promote discounts to high-intent shoppers | E-commerce |
| Email newsletter affiliates | Promotions to engaged niche audiences | Any category |
| Influencer affiliates | Creator endorsements with commission tracking | B2C, consumer apps |
| B2B partner affiliates | Consultants, agencies recommending to clients | B2B SaaS |
| Co-marketing partners | Companies with adjacent products and shared audiences | SaaS, B2B |

## Commission Structure

### Commission Models
| Model | Works Best When |
|---|---|
| Flat fee per conversion | Clear conversion value, easy to model |
| % of first order/sale | E-commerce, variable order values |
| % of recurring revenue | SaaS subscriptions (usually 20-30% for 12 months) |
| Tiered (higher volume = higher %) | Motivating top performers to scale |
| Hybrid (flat + recurring) | SaaS wanting to attract serious promoters |

### Competitive Commission Benchmarks
- SaaS: 20-30% MRR for 12 months, or flat $50-200 per signup
- E-commerce: 5-20% of order value
- Lead generation: $5-50 per qualified lead depending on LTV
- Financial/high-LTV products: $100-500+ per conversion

**Rule:** Your commission must make sense against customer LTV and CAC. If your LTV is $500, paying $100 per affiliate conversion is often viable.

## Platform Selection

| Platform | Best For | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| Impact | Mid-market to enterprise | Advanced tracking, contract management |
| PartnerStack | B2B SaaS | Partner portal, co-sell tools |
| Rewardful | SaaS, simple setup | Stripe integration, easy onboarding |
| Tapfiliate | SMB, multi-channel | White-label, multi-level support |
| ShareASale | E-commerce, large network | Access to established affiliate pool |
| CJ Affiliate | Large brands | Big affiliate network, advanced reporting |
| Refersion | E-commerce, Shopify | Deep e-commerce integrations |

## Affiliate Recruitment

### Finding Affiliates

**Warm sources (highest quality):**
- Existing customers who've already referred others organically
- Partners / integrations who serve the same audience
- Industry bloggers and newsletter writers in your category
- Agencies or consultants who work with your ICP

**Cold outreach:**
- Identify who ranks for "[Your category] + best/top/review" keywords
- Reach out to those already promoting competitors
- Find active contributors in industry communities

### Recruitment Outreach
> "Hi [Name], I came across [their content/site/newsletter] and noticed you cover [topic]. We built [product] for exactly the audience you serve. We have an affiliate program with [commission]. Would this be a fit for your audience?"

### Affiliate Onboarding Kit
Provide every new affiliate with:
- Welcome guide (how the program works, how to earn)
- Pre-written promotional copy and email templates
- Creative assets (banners, product images, logos)
- Unique tracking link and coupon code setup
- Clear rules: what they can and cannot say/do

## Program Management

### Compliance Rules
- No paid search on your brand terms (without written approval)
- No misleading claims or false scarcity
- FTC disclosure requirements (must disclose affiliate relationship)
- No self-referral
- No coupon stacking beyond your terms

### Keeping Affiliates Active
- Monthly newsletter with performance updates, promotions, new creatives
- Tiered incentives: unlock better commissions at volume milestones
- Featured affiliate spotlight (recognition motivates)
- Early access to new features and products
- Dedicated affiliate manager contact

### Affiliate Quality Monitoring
Watch for:
- Cookie stuffing or click fraud (sudden spike in clicks with no conversions)
- Coupon abuse (code being shared publicly outside their channel)
- Brand mis-representation in their content
- Traffic from unexpected geographies

## Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |

| Revenue per active affiliate | Quality of affiliate base |
