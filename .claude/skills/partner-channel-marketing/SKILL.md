# Partner & Channel Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Partner marketing multiplies your reach by leveraging others' audiences, relationships, and distribution channels. The best partnerships are win-win: your partner gets something valuable (revenue, better product, credibility for their audience), and you get access to customers you'd struggle to reach efficiently on your own.

**Partner fit test:** Does your partner's audience/customer base contain a meaningful number of your ideal customers? If yes, explore. If not, even a "great relationship" won't produce results.

## Partner Types

| Partner Type | What They Do | Revenue Model |
|---|---|---|
| Referral partner | Refers customers to you | Commission per referral |
| Reseller | Sells your product to their customers | Margin / reseller discount |
| Integration partner | Builds or maintains product integrations | Usually mutual; sometimes revenue share |
| Agency / consulting partner | Implements your product for clients | Margin, certification, leads |
| Strategic / co-sell partner | Jointly sell and market complementary products | Revenue share, co-sell agreement |
| Technology partner | Product integrates into their platform (or vice versa) | API ecosystem |
| OEM partner | Embeds your product in their offering | License fee |

## Building a Partner Program

## Partner Recruitment

### Identifying Partner Candidates
- **Integration ecosystem:** Companies whose products your customers also use
- **Agency ecosystem:** Agencies that serve your ICP — they already have the relationships
- **Community leaders:** Influencers or thought leaders with significant audiences in your niche
- **Adjacent SaaS:** Non-competing products sold to the same buyer

### Outreach Approach
> "Hi [Name], our customers consistently use [their product] alongside [our product]. We think there's a genuine opportunity to work together — our audiences overlap significantly. We've built some co-marketing ideas and I'd love to explore whether they'd make sense. Would a 20-minute call be worthwhile?"

### Evaluating Partner Fit
Score on:
- Audience overlap with your ICP (quality + quantity)
- Partner's motivation to promote (what's in it for them?)
- Technical integration feasibility (if relevant)
- Reputational alignment
- Sales culture and bandwidth to actively promote

## Co-Marketing Campaigns

### Co-Marketing Formats
- **Joint webinar or event:** Both companies promote to their lists; both get leads
- **Co-authored content:** Research report, guide, or blog post under both brands
- **Bundle or joint offer:** Package both products together with pricing incentive
- **Partner spotlight:** Feature partner to your audience; they feature you to theirs
- **Integration launch:** Announce a new integration with coordinated promotion

### Co-Marketing Campaign Planning
1. Align on shared objective: What does success look like for both parties?
2. Define audience: Whose list? Both? Target account overlap?
3. Agree on contribution: Who creates what? Who promotes where?
4. Set lead sharing terms: How are shared leads attributed and handled?
5. Plan follow-up: Each party follows up with their own leads

## Partner Enablement

Partners need to be able to sell your product as easily as their own.

### Sales Enablement Kit
- 2-minute product explainer video
- One-pager (product + partner benefits)
- Ideal customer profile criteria
- Qualification questions to identify good-fit leads
- Objection handling guide
- Competitive positioning vs. alternatives
- Pricing and packaging overview

### Training Program
- Product knowledge (features, use cases, value props)
- Sales skills for your product (qualifying, demo, closing)
- Technical training (if implementation/integration required)
- Certification to drive commitment and signal credibility

## MDF (Market Development Funds)

MDF are co-marketing budgets provided to partners to fund marketing activities.

**Best uses of MDF:**
- Events and tradeshows
- Digital advertising campaigns
- Content creation (whitepapers, videos)
- In-person workshops with prospects

**MDF approval criteria:**
- Activity aligns with your target segment
- Partner has plan to measure and report results
