# Partner & Channel Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Partner marketing multiplies your reach by leveraging others' audiences, relationships, and distribution channels. The best partnerships are win-win: your partner gets something valuable (revenue, better product, credibility for their audience), and you get access to customers you'd struggle to reach efficiently on your own.

**Partner fit test:** Does your partner's audience/customer base contain a meaningful number of your ideal customers? If yes, explore. If not, even a "great relationship" won't produce results.


## Expert Foundations

**Jay McBain — Channel Ecosystem Research (Forrester)**
McBain's channel ecosystem framework: the future of B2B go-to-market is ecosystem-led growth, not direct sales-led growth. By 2025, 75% of B2B technology purchasing decisions are influenced by a partner, advisor, or community. The implication: your most valuable sales channel isn't your sales team — it's the network of partners who advise your buyers before your sales team ever reaches them.

**Peter Drucker — Distribution Channel Theory**
Drucker's principle: the most underappreciated competitive advantage is distribution. A better product will lose to a better-distributed product every time. Partner channels multiply distribution without multiplying headcount.

### Channel Partner Types

| Partner Type | How They Drive Revenue | What They Need from You |
|---|---|---|
| Referral partners | Send leads, take a commission | Simple referral agreement, commission tracking, co-marketing |
| Resellers | Buy and resell your product | Margins, sales training, sales collateral |
| System integrators | Implement your product for clients | Technical certification, project support, lead sharing |
| Technology partners (ISVs) | Bundle your product with theirs | API / integration support, joint marketing budget |
| Agency / consultancy partners | Recommend your product to clients | Preferred partner status, co-sell support, co-marketing |
| Distributors | Handle volume indirect sales | Volume discounts, inventory, admin support |

### Partner Tiers

Structure partners into tiers based on revenue contribution:

| Tier | Revenue Threshold | Benefits |
|---|---|---|
| Gold / Strategic | Top 10-20% of partners | Dedicated partner manager, MDF, co-sell, executive access |
| Silver / Select | Next 20-30% | Joint marketing support, deal registration, preferred pricing |
| Registered | All others | Partner portal access, basic training, standard commission |

### Partner Enablement Kit

Every new partner needs:
1. **Partner agreement** — commission terms, exclusivity (if any), rules of engagement
2. **Product training** — positioning, demo, competitive differentiation
3. **Sales collateral** — one-pager, pitch deck, case studies adapted for their clients
4. **Lead registration process** — how they register deals to claim commission
5. **Partner portal access** — marketing assets, deal tracking, commission reporting
6. **Success metrics** — what good looks like; what triggers tier review

### Co-Sell vs. Co-Market

**Co-sell:** Joint selling motion — your AE and the partner's team both involved in closing a deal. Requires tight sales alignment, clean territory rules, and a clear commission split.

**Co-market:** Joint marketing activities — joint webinar, co-branded content, shared email to each other's lists. Lower commitment, easier to start.

*Start with co-marketing to build the relationship. Move to co-sell once trust and processes are established.*

### Partner Program Metrics

|---|---|
| Partner-sourced revenue | Revenue from partner-referred deals |
| Partner-influenced revenue | Revenue where a partner was involved at any point |

| Partner CAC vs. direct CAC | Partner channel efficiency |
| Time to first deal (new partners) | Onboarding effectiveness |

## Partner Types

| Partner Type | What They Do | Revenue Model |
|---|---|---|

| Reseller | Sells your product to their customers | Margin / reseller discount |
| Integration partner | Builds or maintains product integrations | Usually mutual; sometimes revenue share |
| Agency / consulting partner | Implements your product for clients | Margin, certification, leads |
| Strategic / co-sell partner | Jointly sell and market complementary products | Revenue share, co-sell agreement |
| Technology partner | Product integrates into their platform (or vice versa) | API ecosystem |
| OEM partner | Embeds your product in their offering | License fee |

### Partner Portal Essentials

## Partner Recruitment

### Identifying Partner Candidates
- **Integration ecosystem:** Companies whose products your customers also use
- **Agency ecosystem:** Agencies that serve your ICP — they already have the relationships
- **Community leaders:** Influencers or thought leaders with significant audiences in your niche
- **Adjacent SaaS:** Non-competing products sold to the same buyer

### Outreach Approach
> "Hi [Name], our customers consistently use [their product] alongside [our product]. We think there's a genuine opportunity to work together — our audiences overlap significantly. We've built some co-marketing ideas and I'd love to explore whether they'd make sense. Would a 20-minute call be worthwhile?"

### Evaluating Partner Fit
Score on:
- Audience overlap with your ICP (quality + quantity)
- Partner's motivation to promote (what's in it for them?)
- Technical integration feasibility (if relevant)
- Reputational alignment
- Sales culture and bandwidth to actively promote

## Co-Marketing Campaigns

### Co-Marketing Formats
- **Joint webinar or event:** Both companies promote to their lists; both get leads
- **Co-authored content:** Research report, guide, or blog post under both brands
- **Bundle or joint offer:** Package both products together with pricing incentive
- **Partner spotlight:** Feature partner to your audience; they feature you to theirs
- **Integration launch:** Announce a new integration with coordinated promotion

### Co-Marketing Campaign Planning
1. Align on shared objective: What does success look like for both parties?
2. Define audience: Whose list? Both? Target account overlap?
3. Agree on contribution: Who creates what? Who promotes where?
4. Set lead sharing terms: How are shared leads attributed and handled?
5. Plan follow-up: Each party follows up with their own leads
