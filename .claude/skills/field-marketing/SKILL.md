# Field Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Field marketing brings marketing into the field — supporting sales teams at the territory level with local events, customer engagement, and pipeline-building activities that corporate campaigns can't personalize to a region. The best field marketers think like a regional sales leader who happens to have marketing skills.

**Field marketing's job:** Generate and accelerate pipeline for sales teams in specific territories or verticals.

## Field Marketing vs. Corporate Marketing

| Dimension | Corporate Marketing | Field Marketing |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Global or company-wide | Regional, territory, or vertical |
| Goal | Brand, demand gen, leads | Pipeline generation and acceleration |
| Execution | Centralized team | Distributed, locally adaptive |
| Content | Broadly relevant | Locally/vertically specific |
| Relationship | Brand-to-market | Face-to-face |
| Metrics | MQLs, traffic, impressions | Pipeline created, meetings booked, deals closed |

## Field Marketing Programs

### Pipeline Generation Activities

**Executive Roundtables**
Small, intimate dinners (8-12 people) with a relevant speaker and peer discussion — no product pitch.
- Theme: A strategic topic the target audience cares about
- Attendees: Target titles + existing customers as social proof
- Speaker: External thought leader or internal executive
- Format: 60-90 min dinner, facilitated discussion, relationship building
- Follow-up: Personalized next-step from sales within 24 hours

**Prospect Events**
- Happy hours co-hosted with a partner at a conference
- Workshop or training session on a topic your ICP cares about
- VIP sporting or cultural event for key accounts

**Lunch & Learns**
- In-person or virtual educational session for a prospect's team
- Content led, not product demo — build trust first
- Sales request: to get in front of a broader group at target account

### Pipeline Acceleration Activities

**Customer Advisory Boards**
- 4-8 strategic customers meet quarterly to advise on roadmap
- Strengthens relationship + generates expansion opportunities
- Recruits advocates who will speak for you in prospect conversations

**Customer Expansion Events**
- User group dinners or events for existing customers in a territory
- Goal: Deepen relationships, surface upsell opportunities, generate referrals

**Executive Briefings (EBCs)**
- Bring key accounts to your office for a high-touch executive experience
- Customize the agenda to their specific challenges
- Involve your senior leadership

### Sales Enablement

Field marketing enables sales with:
- Local customer stories and case studies (same industry or geography as prospect)
- Territory-specific battle cards
- Local partner relationships
- Event invites and calendar to share with prospects
- Co-marketing with regional technology partners or agencies

## Territory Planning

### Territory Field Marketing Plan Elements
1. **Territory overview:** Geography, accounts, pipeline coverage
2. **Target account list:** Top 25-50 accounts to focus programs on
3. **Key sales plays:** What is sales running in this territory?
4. **Program calendar:** Events and activities by quarter
5. **Partner map:** Who can amplify in this territory?
6. **Budget allocation:** Per-quarter breakdown by program type
7. **Success metrics:** Pipeline sourced/influenced targets

### Field Budget Allocation (sample)
- 40% Pipeline events (roundtables, happy hours, workshops)
- 25% Customer engagement (user groups, EBCs, expansion)
- 20% Sales enablement (content, collateral, tools)
- 15% Partner co-marketing

## Sales & Marketing Alignment

Field marketing is the interface between marketing and sales. Relationship quality determines program impact.

**Operating rhythm with sales:**
- **Weekly:** Sync with regional sales leads — what's happening in pipeline, what do they need?
- **Monthly:** Review pipeline contribution from field programs; adjust next month's plan
- **Quarterly:** Territory planning meeting with sales leadership; agree on goals and programs

**The test of good field marketing:** Sales proactively calls field marketers because they find them valuable.
