# Field Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Field marketing brings marketing into the field — supporting sales teams at the territory level with local events, customer engagement, and pipeline-building activities that corporate campaigns can't personalize to a region. The best field marketers think like a regional sales leader who happens to have marketing skills.

**Field marketing's job:** Generate and accelerate pipeline for sales teams in specific territories or verticals.


## Expert Foundations

**Sangram Vajre — ABM and Field Marketing**
Vajre's field marketing principle: field marketing is the connective tissue between corporate marketing and sales. It fails when it operates as a separate function. It succeeds when the field marketer is embedded with the sales team — owning the territory pipeline number, not just event attendance.

**SiriusDecisions / Forrester Research**
Research consensus: field marketing events generate 23% of total pipeline for enterprise B2B companies when executed with the right account targeting and sales follow-up. The key variable is post-event follow-up speed — deals sourced from events where sales followed up within 24 hours close 40% faster than those followed up after 72+ hours.

### Field Marketing as Territory Ownership

Field marketers own a geographic or vertical territory and are accountable for:
- Pipeline generated from that territory
- Relationships built at target accounts in that territory
- Sales enablement for the sales team covering that territory

**The field marketer's role is not to run events.** It's to accelerate revenue in a territory. Events are one tool.

### Territory Mapping

Before any field activity, map the territory:

| Account | Tier | AE Owner | Current Stage | Next Event Touchpoint | Relationship Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Tier 1 accounts** (top 10-20): Deserve custom field investment — private dinners, executive briefings, bespoke outreach
**Tier 2 accounts** (next 50-100): Group events — regional roundtables, user groups, sponsored conferences
**Tier 3 accounts** (next 200-500): Broad events and digital — webinars, sponsored conference presence

### Event Types for Field Marketing

| Event Type | Tier | Pipeline Yield | Time Investment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executive dinner (8-12 people) | Tier 1 | High — intimate relationship building | High |
| Customer roundtable (15-25) | Tier 1-2 | High — peer validation | Medium |
| Regional roadshow (50-200) | Tier 2-3 | Medium — broad awareness | Medium |
| Conference sponsorship | All tiers | Low-Medium — depends on follow-up | High cost |
| Sponsored happy hour | Tier 2-3 | Medium — networking | Low |
| Virtual event (field-hosted) | Tier 3 | Low | Low |

### Sales Enablement Alignment

Field marketing should produce for sales:
- Pre-event target account list with context (what they care about, recent news)
- Post-event follow-up email templates (send within 24 hours)
- ROI metrics per event for quarterly business reviews
- Competitive intelligence from field conversations

### Field Marketing Metrics

| Metric | Target / Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Pipeline sourced (events) | 15-25% of territory pipeline |
| Pipeline influenced (events) | 30-40% of territory pipeline |
| MQL to SQL conversion from events | 25-35% (vs. 10-15% for inbound) |
| Cost per pipeline opportunity | $500-2,500 for regional events |
| Post-event follow-up rate (sales) | >80% within 24 hours |

## Field Marketing vs. Corporate Marketing

| Dimension | Corporate Marketing | Field Marketing |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Global or company-wide | Regional, territory, or vertical |
| Goal | Brand, demand gen, leads | Pipeline generation and acceleration |
| Execution | Centralized team | Distributed, locally adaptive |
| Content | Broadly relevant | Locally/vertically specific |
| Relationship | Brand-to-market | Face-to-face |
| Metrics | MQLs, traffic, impressions | Pipeline created, meetings booked, deals closed |

## Field Marketing Programs

### Pipeline Generation Activities

**Executive Roundtables**
Small, intimate dinners (8-12 people) with a relevant speaker and peer discussion — no product pitch.
- Theme: A strategic topic the target audience cares about
- Attendees: Target titles + existing customers as social proof
- Speaker: External thought leader or internal executive
- Format: 60-90 min dinner, facilitated discussion, relationship building
- Follow-up: Personalized next-step from sales within 24 hours

**Prospect Events**
- Happy hours co-hosted with a partner at a conference
- Workshop or training session on a topic your ICP cares about
- VIP sporting or cultural event for key accounts

**Lunch & Learns**
- In-person or virtual educational session for a prospect's team
- Content led, not product demo — build trust first
- Sales request: to get in front of a broader group at target account

### Pipeline Acceleration Activities

**Customer Advisory Boards**
- 4-8 strategic customers meet quarterly to advise on roadmap
- Strengthens relationship + generates expansion opportunities
- Recruits advocates who will speak for you in prospect conversations

**Customer Expansion Events**
- User group dinners or events for existing customers in a territory
- Goal: Deepen relationships, surface upsell opportunities, generate referrals

**Executive Briefings (EBCs)**
- Bring key accounts to your office for a high-touch executive experience
- Customize the agenda to their specific challenges
- Involve your senior leadership

### Sales Enablement

Field marketing enables sales with:
- Local customer stories and case studies (same industry or geography as prospect)
- Territory-specific battle cards
- Local partner relationships
- Event invites and calendar to share with prospects
- Co-marketing with regional technology partners or agencies

## Territory Planning

### Territory Field Marketing Plan Elements
1. **Territory overview:** Geography, accounts, pipeline coverage
2. **Target account list:** Top 25-50 accounts to focus programs on
3. **Key sales plays:** What is sales running in this territory?
4. **Program calendar:** Events and activities by quarter
5. **Partner map:** Who can amplify in this territory?
6. **Budget allocation:** Per-quarter breakdown by program type
7. **Success metrics:** Pipeline sourced/influenced targets

### Field Budget Allocation (sample)
- 40% Pipeline events (roundtables, happy hours, workshops)
- 25% Customer engagement (user groups, EBCs, expansion)
- 20% Sales enablement (content, collateral, tools)
- 15% Partner co-marketing

## Sales & Marketing Alignment

Field marketing is the interface between marketing and sales. Relationship quality determines program impact.

**Operating rhythm with sales:**
- **Weekly:** Sync with regional sales leads — what's happening in pipeline, what do they need?
- **Monthly:** Review pipeline contribution from field programs; adjust next month's plan
- **Quarterly:** Territory planning meeting with sales leadership; agree on goals and programs

**The test of good field marketing:** Sales proactively calls field marketers because they find them valuable.
