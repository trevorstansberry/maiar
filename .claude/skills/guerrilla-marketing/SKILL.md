# Guerrilla Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Guerrilla marketing achieves outsized impact through surprise, creativity, and unconventional tactics rather than budget. The currency is attention — specifically, earned attention from people who encounter something they didn't expect and feel compelled to share it.

**The guerrilla test:** Would someone take a photo of this and send it to a friend? If yes, it has guerrilla potential.


## Expert Foundations

**Jay Conrad Levinson — Guerrilla Marketing (1984, updated)**
Levinson coined the term and defined the philosophy: guerrilla marketing is achieving conventional marketing goals through unconventional means, using time, energy, and imagination rather than money. The original insight was that small businesses could compete with large corporations by being more creative, more personal, and more surprising.

**Key principle:** Guerrilla tactics get attention by breaking the expected pattern. Attention is the scarce resource — guerrilla marketing earns it instead of buying it.

### 7 Levers of Guerrilla Marketing

1. **Surprise and delight:** Do something nobody expects at a place where your audience already is
2. **Extreme specificity:** Hyper-targeted to one audience in one place — not broad messaging
3. **Emotional resonance:** Makes people feel something strong enough to share
4. **Participatory:** Invites the audience to interact, not just observe
5. **Social currency:** Creates something people want to tell others about (Jonah Berger's STEPPS)
6. **Newsworthiness:** Gets covered as news — earned media multiplies reach
7. **Low cost, high craft:** Success comes from creativity, not spend

### Guerrilla Tactic Categories

| Category | Examples | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Street / environmental | Chalk art, sticker campaigns, wild posting, flash mobs | B2C, local brands, product launches |
| Ambient | Placing your brand in unexpected physical contexts | Awareness, memorable association |
| Stunt / PR | Outrageous or newsworthy acts that get media coverage | Launches, visibility pushes |
| Online / digital guerrilla | Meme hijacking, viral challenges, tactical Reddit/Twitter moves | B2C, younger audiences |
| Experiential pop-up | Temporary branded installations or events | Brand building, product sampling |
| Newsjacking | Inserting your brand into a breaking news moment (relevant + fast) | Any brand with quick execution |
| Community infiltration | Genuinely showing up in communities, not advertising in them | B2B, trust-first categories |

### Virality Mechanics (Jonah Berger's STEPPS)

For a guerrilla tactic to spread organically:
- **Social currency:** Does sharing it make the person look good or interesting?
- **Triggers:** What in daily life will remind people of the campaign?
- **Emotion:** Does it make people feel something strongly?
- **Public:** Is it visible? Can others see when people participate?
- **Practical value:** Does it provide useful information worth sharing?
- **Stories:** Does it wrap a message in a narrative?

### What Makes a Guerrilla Tactic Fail

- Feels like an ad pretending not to be an ad
- Targets the wrong context (irrelevant to the audience's life)
- Too subtle — people don't understand the connection to your brand
- Too overt — feels desperate or gimmicky
- Not sharable — great in-person experience with no digital life
- Gets brand into controversy without upside

### Measurement

Guerrilla marketing is hard to measure directly. Track:
- Earned media mentions and reach
- Social media impressions and shares from UGC
- Branded search volume lift (week of + week after)
- Direct website traffic lift in target geography
- Qualitative interviews / NPS shift for brand recall

## Types of Guerrilla Marketing

### Street / Ambient Marketing
Physical installations, stickers, projections, or art in unexpected public locations.
- **Flash mobs:** Choreographed public performances that feel spontaneous
- **Chalk art:** Temporary street art at relevant locations
- **Projections:** Brand message or art projected on buildings at night
- **Ambient installations:** Using public furniture, sidewalks, or spaces as a canvas

**Examples:**
- Folgers Coffee placing fake manhole covers on NYC streets with steam rising that said "Folgers: City That Never Sleeps"
- A mattress company placing a giant alarm clock at a train station for their "best sleep" campaign

### Stunt Marketing
A planned event or action designed to generate media coverage and social sharing.
- **Extreme stunts:** Redbull's Felix Baumgartner space jump
- **Protest / counter-narrative:** Positioning brand as challenger to status quo
- **Unexpected scale:** Doing something at an unexpected scale or location
- **Product demos as stunts:** Blendtec's "Will It Blend?" videos

**Stunt checklist:**
- Is it inherently visual? (required for social/media coverage)
- Does it connect to the brand message? (brand-disconnected stunts don't build recall)
- Is it safe and legal? (guerrilla ≠ reckless)
- Do you have a distribution plan for the footage/photos?
- Can you amplify with PR outreach to journalists?

### Digital Guerrilla
Unconventional digital tactics that generate organic attention:
- **Newsjacking:** Respond rapidly to trending news with brand-relevant commentary
- **Comment marketing:** Insightful, funny comments on high-traffic posts that drive profile visits
- **Easter eggs:** Hidden content or surprises in digital products that people discover and share
- **Unexpected landing pages:** Pages that break conventions in memorable ways (Cards Against Humanity's "Black Friday" campaigns)
- **Competitor hijacking (careful):** Bid on competitor brand terms; set up comparative landing pages

### Experiential Pop-Ups
Temporary physical experiences that create shareable moments:
- Pop-up shops in unexpected locations
- Brand-sponsored "free" experiences (free coffee, free umbrella when raining, free wifi hotspot)
- Interactive brand experiences at relevant events
- Branded photo opportunities designed for social sharing

### Collaborative / Unexpected Partnerships
- Brand collaboration that no one expected but feels perfect in hindsight
- Co-create with a creator, artist, or non-competing brand whose audience overlaps yours
- "Ambush marketing" at events (being present at an event you don't sponsor)

## Guerrilla Campaign Framework

### 1. Start with the Insight
What's something true about your audience, your brand, or your market that most people would recognize but rarely articulate? The best guerrilla marketing makes people say "yes, exactly."

### 2. Find the Unexpected Angle
How can you express that insight in a way that's surprising, counterintuitive, or visually striking?

### 3. Choose the Right Canvas
Where will this have maximum impact?
- High-traffic physical location
- Trending digital conversation
- Relevant event or gathering

### 4. Design for Shareability
- What's the photo moment?
- What's the caption someone would write?
- Does it work without explanation?

### 5. Plan Distribution
Don't rely solely on organic discovery:
- Have a photographer/videographer ready
- Seed the content to relevant media and social accounts
- PR outreach to journalists in relevant beats
- Influencer documentation if applicable

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Permit requirements:** Many street installations require permits; check local regulations
- **Private property:** Always secure permission for anything on private property
- **Safety:** Never create anything that could cause injury or public panic
- **Brand safety:** Ensure the stunt can't be misinterpreted or co-opted negatively
- **Competitor mention:** Comparative advertising must be factually accurate

## Budget Reality

Guerrilla marketing's appeal is high impact at low cost — but "low cost" is relative:
- True guerrilla (chalk + creativity): $100-$1,000
- Ambient installation: $1,000-$10,000
- Professional stunt with PR support: $10,000-$100,000
- Large-scale activation: $100,000+

**The real cost is creative labor and PR distribution** — often more than the physical production.
