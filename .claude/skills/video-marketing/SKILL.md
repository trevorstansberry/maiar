# Video Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Video is the highest-bandwidth communication format — it conveys tone, credibility, and personality faster than any other medium. But "video marketing" is not one thing. A 3-second TikTok hook and a 15-minute YouTube tutorial require completely different approaches.

**The video marketing question:** What is the one thing I want the viewer to think, feel, or do after watching?


## Expert Foundations

**Wistia — B2B Video Research**
Wistia's data on 300,000+ videos shows that engagement drops sharply after the 2-minute mark for videos over 10 minutes, but videos under 2 minutes maintain 70%+ retention. The implication: most B2B video content is too long. The hook-hold-CTA structure — strong opening hook, sustained value, single clear CTA — is the highest-performing format in B2B video.

**YouTube's Algorithm (Creator Economy Framework)**
YouTube's recommendation engine prioritizes Click-Through Rate (CTR) × Average View Duration (AVD). A video with a 10% CTR but 30% AVD beats a video with 5% CTR and 80% AVD. The actionable insight: thumbnails and titles win clicks; the first 30 seconds win retention. Both are required for algorithmic distribution.

### Hook-Hold-CTA Structure

Every high-performing video follows this arc:

1. **Hook (0-30 seconds):** State the problem, tease the payoff, or make a provocative claim. Never "welcome back to our channel." Start with what matters to the viewer.
2. **Hold (middle):** Deliver the promised value. Use B-roll, screen recordings, and chapter markers for YouTube to maintain retention.
3. **CTA (final 15-20%):** Single clear action. External link in description, subscribe, or "watch this next" card.

## Platform Strategy

### YouTube (Long-Form)
YouTube is the world's second-largest search engine. Treat it as SEO.

**Content strategy:**
- Research keywords with YouTube autocomplete + VidIQ / TubeBuddy
- Create videos that answer specific questions or solve specific problems
- Build a topic cluster: multiple videos on related topics that link to each other
- Publish consistently: 1x/week beats 4x/week for 1 month then nothing

**YouTube SEO:**
- Title: Include keyword, 60 characters max, front-load the benefit
- Thumbnail: High contrast, human face (if relevant), readable text at small size
- Description: 200+ words with keyword naturally included, chapters, links
- Tags: Primary keyword + variations
- First 24-48 hours of performance determines long-term reach

### Short-Form (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
Short-form is discovery-first. Optimized for the For You page, not your existing followers.

**The 3-second hook rule:** If the first 3 seconds don't demand attention, stop scrolling.

**Hook formulas:**
- Bold claim: "Most [audience] are doing [thing] wrong."
- Curiosity gap: "I tried [unusual thing] for 30 days. Here's what happened."
- Pattern interrupt: Start mid-story or with the most interesting moment
- Direct promise: "In the next 60 seconds, you'll know how to [result]."

**Short-form structure:**
1. Hook (0-3 seconds): Stop the scroll
2. Context (3-8 seconds): Why should they keep watching?
3. Content (8-50 seconds): Deliver the value
4. CTA (last 5 seconds): What to do next (comment, follow, click link)

### Product Demo / Explainer Videos
- Lead with the problem the viewer has, not the product
- Show the transformation: before → after
- Use screen recordings for SaaS; clean product shots for physical
- Subtitles are mandatory (85%+ of social video viewed without sound)
- Keep under 2 minutes for awareness; can go longer for consideration-stage buyers

## Video Production

### Minimum Viable Setup
- Camera: iPhone 13+ or any mirrorless camera with autofocus
- Audio: Lavalier mic (~$30-50) or USB condenser mic for desk recording
- Lighting: A $30-50 ring light or position near a window
- **Sound > Image quality.** Bad audio loses viewers instantly.

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Clear objective: what should the viewer think/feel/do?
- [ ] Script or outline (even for "casual" videos — know your points)
- [ ] Location/backdrop selected (clean, branded, or intentional)
- [ ] Equipment tested
- [ ] Subtitles planned (auto-generated + reviewed)

### Scripting Format
- Write for ears, not eyes — short sentences, natural language, contractions
- Open with a hook, not an introduction
- Avoid "Hi, I'm X from X company" as the opening line
- Read it aloud — if it sounds stiff, it will feel stiff on camera

## Video Distribution

**Own the asset, distribute everywhere:**
1. Publish natively on each platform (native beats links)
2. Upload to YouTube (even if TikTok-first) for long-term SEO value
3. Embed in relevant blog posts
4. Include in email campaigns (use thumbnail + play button image linking to video)
5. Repurpose: clips → social posts, transcript → blog post, audio → podcast episode

## Video Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| View count | Reach |
| Watch time / Avg view duration | Content quality and hook effectiveness |
| View-through rate (VTR) | % who watched to a point (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) |
| CTR on thumbnail | Thumbnail + title effectiveness |
| Engagement rate | Likes, comments, shares relative to views |
| Subscriber gain per video | Channel growth efficiency |
| Conversion from video | Business impact (form fills, signups, purchases) |
