# Video Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Video is the highest-bandwidth communication format — it conveys tone, credibility, and personality faster than any other medium. But "video marketing" is not one thing. A 3-second TikTok hook and a 15-minute YouTube tutorial require completely different approaches.

**The video marketing question:** What is the one thing I want the viewer to think, feel, or do after watching?

## Video Types by Goal

| Goal | Video Type | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Brand awareness | Brand story, manifesto | 60-90 seconds |
| Education / Thought leadership | Tutorial, explainer, deep dive | 5-15 minutes (YouTube) |
| Product consideration | Demo, product walkthrough | 2-5 minutes |
| Decision / Conversion | Testimonial, case study, ROI video | 1-3 minutes |
| Social distribution | Short-form (Reel, TikTok, Short) | 15-60 seconds |
| Retention / Community | Behind-the-scenes, team content | 1-5 minutes |
| Webinar / Education | Live event recording | 30-60 minutes |

## Platform Strategy

### YouTube (Long-Form)
YouTube is the world's second-largest search engine. Treat it as SEO.

**Content strategy:**
- Research keywords with YouTube autocomplete + VidIQ / TubeBuddy
- Create videos that answer specific questions or solve specific problems
- Build a topic cluster: multiple videos on related topics that link to each other
- Publish consistently: 1x/week beats 4x/week for 1 month then nothing

**YouTube SEO:**
- Title: Include keyword, 60 characters max, front-load the benefit
- Thumbnail: High contrast, human face (if relevant), readable text at small size
- Description: 200+ words with keyword naturally included, chapters, links
- Tags: Primary keyword + variations
- First 24-48 hours of performance determines long-term reach

### Short-Form (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
Short-form is discovery-first. Optimized for the For You page, not your existing followers.

**The 3-second hook rule:** If the first 3 seconds don't demand attention, stop scrolling.

**Hook formulas:**
- Bold claim: "Most [audience] are doing [thing] wrong."
- Curiosity gap: "I tried [unusual thing] for 30 days. Here's what happened."
- Pattern interrupt: Start mid-story or with the most interesting moment
- Direct promise: "In the next 60 seconds, you'll know how to [result]."

**Short-form structure:**
1. Hook (0-3 seconds): Stop the scroll
2. Context (3-8 seconds): Why should they keep watching?
3. Content (8-50 seconds): Deliver the value
4. CTA (last 5 seconds): What to do next (comment, follow, click link)

### Product Demo / Explainer Videos
- Lead with the problem the viewer has, not the product
- Show the transformation: before → after
- Use screen recordings for SaaS; clean product shots for physical
- Subtitles are mandatory (85%+ of social video viewed without sound)
- Keep under 2 minutes for awareness; can go longer for consideration-stage buyers

## Video Production

### Minimum Viable Setup
- Camera: iPhone 13+ or any mirrorless camera with autofocus
- Audio: Lavalier mic (~$30-50) or USB condenser mic for desk recording
- Lighting: A $30-50 ring light or position near a window
- **Sound > Image quality.** Bad audio loses viewers instantly.

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Clear objective: what should the viewer think/feel/do?
- [ ] Script or outline (even for "casual" videos — know your points)
- [ ] Location/backdrop selected (clean, branded, or intentional)
- [ ] Equipment tested
- [ ] Subtitles planned (auto-generated + reviewed)

### Scripting Format
- Write for ears, not eyes — short sentences, natural language, contractions
- Open with a hook, not an introduction
- Avoid "Hi, I'm X from X company" as the opening line
- Read it aloud — if it sounds stiff, it will feel stiff on camera

## Video Distribution

**Own the asset, distribute everywhere:**
1. Publish natively on each platform (native beats links)
2. Upload to YouTube (even if TikTok-first) for long-term SEO value
3. Embed in relevant blog posts
4. Include in email campaigns (use thumbnail + play button image linking to video)
5. Repurpose: clips → social posts, transcript → blog post, audio → podcast episode

## Video Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| View count | Reach |
| Watch time / Avg view duration | Content quality and hook effectiveness |
| View-through rate (VTR) | % who watched to a point (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) |
| CTR on thumbnail | Thumbnail + title effectiveness |
| Engagement rate | Likes, comments, shares relative to views |
| Subscriber gain per video | Channel growth efficiency |
| Conversion from video | Business impact (form fills, signups, purchases) |
