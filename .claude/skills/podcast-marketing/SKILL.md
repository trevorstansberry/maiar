# Podcast Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Podcasting builds the deepest audience relationship of any content format. Listeners spend 20-40 minutes with you, often during commute or exercise — a level of attention no other medium gets. A podcast is a long-game brand asset, not a quick lead gen tool.

**Two roles in podcast marketing:**
1. **Running a podcast** — You host and publish content
2. **Podcast PR / guest appearances** — You get booked on others' shows

Both are legitimate strategies with different time horizons.


## Expert Foundations

**Joe Pulizzi — Content Marketing Institute / Podcasting**
Pulizzi's core principle for podcast marketing: treat the show as a business, not a hobby. Define the content tilt (unique angle that differentiates your show in a crowded category) before recording episode one. Without a content tilt, you're competing on production quality alone — a race you can't win against established shows.

**Dave Jackson — School of Podcasting**
Jackson's listener journey framework: listeners are not one audience. They go from strangers who discover the show → new listeners judging if it's worth their time → regular listeners → superfans who promote the show. Each stage requires different content and calls to action.

### Show Strategy Framework

**Define before you launch:**
1. **Content tilt:** What unique angle can you own in this category? Not "marketing tips" but "B2B SaaS marketing tactics with 6-figure budgets."
2. **Target listener:** Who specifically? Job title, stage, problem they're solving.
3. **Show promise:** What will every listener walk away with? Consistency in the promise builds loyalty.
4. **Episode frequency:** Consistency > frequency. Monthly consistently beats weekly sporadically.
5. **Format:** Interview / solo / panel / narrative. Pick based on what your audience prefers and what you can sustain.

### Listener Journey

| Stage | What They Need | What You Do |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | Reason to try the show | Clear show description, targeted show title |
| First episode | Immediate proof of value | Strong "listen to this first" episode |
| Regular listener | Consistent quality + promise | Same format, same quality, same schedule |
| Superfan | Insider access, community | Private community, early access, shoutouts |

### Podcast as B2B Marketing Channel

Podcasts work for B2B because:
- Average listener is college-educated with above-average income
- Listening happens in captive moments (commute, exercise) — no competition with inbox
- Long-form = trust building over time
- Guests become distribution channels (share the episode with their audience)

**Guest selection as distribution strategy:** Target guests with email lists or social audiences that overlap your ICP. Their promotion of the episode is worth more than the content itself.

### Monetization Ladder

1. **Audience building** (0-6 months) — No monetization. Focus on building a loyal core audience.
2. **Sponsorships** (1,000+ downloads/ep) — Mid-roll ads, host-read preferred. Rate: $25-50 CPM.
3. **Premium content** (any stage) — Private feed, bonus episodes, early access for paid subscribers.
4. **Courses / consulting** (any stage) — Show builds authority; CTA drives to paid offer.
5. **Events** (established shows) — Live recordings, listener meetups, virtual summits.

## Running a Branded Podcast

### When a Podcast Makes Sense
- You have unique insights or access that your audience can't get elsewhere
- You can commit to 12+ episodes before seeing meaningful return
- You have guests who will amplify episodes to their audiences
- Your ICP actively consumes podcasts in your category

### Podcast Strategy

**Format options:**
- Solo thought leadership (your perspective, no guests)
- Interview-based (you + guest, most common)
- Co-hosted (you + partner with distinct dynamic)
- Panel / roundtable
- Narrative/documentary (highest production effort)

**Show concept formula:**
- Who is it for? (specific ICP)
- What problem or interest does it serve?
- What's the distinct POV or angle that makes it different from the 100 other shows in this space?
- What do listeners get that they can't get elsewhere?

### Podcast Launch

**Minimum viable launch:**
- 3 episodes ready on launch day (binge-worthy, reduces drop-off)
- Cover art that reads clearly at 200x200 pixels (podcast app thumbnail size)
- 60-second show description with clear keyword inclusion
- Listed on: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and your website

**Launch promotion:**
- Email your list with a warm personal message
- Ask guests from first 3 episodes to share with their audiences
- Post clips to LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X
- Ask for reviews on Apple Podcasts in first 30 days (reviews help early rankings)

### Guest Booking Strategy

**Who makes a great guest:**
- Has genuine audience overlap with your ICP
- Has unique experience or data to share (not just general opinion)
- Will promote the episode to their audience
- Is credible enough to borrow authority from

**Outreach template:**
> Hi [Name], I've followed your work on [topic] for a while — especially [specific thing]. I host [Podcast Name], a show for [audience] about [topic]. I'd love to have you on to talk about [specific angle]. Episodes run ~30-45 minutes; I handle all editing and promotion. Interested?

### Episode Production Workflow
1. Book guest → send prep guide with questions in advance
2. Record (Riverside.fm, Zencastr, or Zoom backup)
3. Edit (remove filler, tighten pacing, add intro/outro)
4. Write show notes (150-300 words, key takeaways, guest links)
5. Create audiogram clips (30-60 seconds for social)
6. Publish + distribute
7. Guest follow-up: share the episode with them + promotion kit

## Podcast Guest Appearances (Podcast PR)

**For founders, executives, and experts:**
Getting on other shows is one of the most efficient ways to reach a highly targeted, engaged audience.

### Targeting the Right Shows
- Search for shows your ICP listens to (ask them directly)
- Use Listen Notes, Rephonic, or Podchaser to find shows by category and size
- Prioritize: mid-size shows (5K-50K listeners) over huge shows (harder to book) and tiny shows (low reach)

### Pitch Template
> Hi [Host Name], I love what you've built with [Show Name] — the episode on [specific episode] really resonated. I'm [Name + brief bio]. I'd love to explore being a guest to talk about [specific topic]. I could speak to [unique angle/data/experience] that I think would resonate with your listeners. Here's my background: [short bio/link]. Happy to send a one-pager if useful.

### Maximizing Each Appearance
- Prepare 3-5 quotable, memorable moments (stories, frameworks, stats)
- Direct listeners to a landing page, not just your homepage (track attribution)
- Send the episode to your own audience (repurpose the co-promotion opportunity)
- Ask for the recording to repurpose as video clips

## Podcast Sponsorships

**Sponsoring others' podcasts:**
- Best for awareness in tight niche markets where your ICP over-indexes
- Mid-roll ads (during the episode) outperform pre/post-roll
- Host-read ads outperform produced ads — buy the host's authentic voice
- Offer exclusive coupon code for attribution tracking

**Typical rates:**
- CPM $15-50 for pre/mid/post roll depending on show size and niche

## Content Repurposing from Podcast

One episode → multiple content pieces:
1. Full episode (audio + video)
2. 3-5 short clips (30-60 seconds each) for social
3. Episode transcript → blog post
4. Key quotes → social graphics
5. Key insights → email newsletter
6. Thread version for Twitter/X or LinkedIn

## Podcast Metrics

| Metric | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Downloads per episode (first 30 days) | 200+ = decent start; 1,000+ = good traction |
| Subscriber growth rate | 10-20%/month healthy in growth phase |
| Listen-through rate | 60%+ means content is landing |
| Guest amplification | % of episodes shared by guest to their audience |
| Traffic from show notes | Attribution of podcast → website → conversion |
