# Referral & Word-of-Mouth Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Word-of-mouth is the most trusted form of marketing — it converts 3-5× better than paid advertising because it carries the social proof of a real person. The best companies engineer it systematically rather than hoping it happens organically.

**The word-of-mouth equation:** Great product + right trigger + easy sharing mechanism = scalable referral engine.

## Why People Refer

Understanding motivation is the foundation of referral design:

1. **Altruism:** "This will genuinely help my friend"
2. **Social currency:** "Sharing this makes me look smart / well-informed"
3. **Identity expression:** "This brand says something about who I am"
4. **Reciprocity:** "They did something for me; I want to give back"
5. **Incentive:** "I get something for referring"

The best referral programs tap into multiple motivations. Incentive alone creates mercenary referrers; altruism alone is unpredictable. Combine them.

## Referral Program Design

### Program Mechanics

| Mechanic | Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Double-sided reward | Both referrer and referee get something | SaaS, subscriptions |
| One-sided (referrer only) | Referrer gets reward | When product sells itself |
| One-sided (referee only) | New customer gets discount | Price-sensitive acquisition |
| Social recognition | Public leaderboard or badge | Community-centric brands |
| Tiered rewards | More referrals = better rewards | High-volume programs |
| Milestone bonuses | Bonus at 5, 10, 25 referrals | Driving sustained effort |

### Reward Options

| Reward Type | Works When |
|---|---|
| Account credit / cash | Product has ongoing value (SaaS, subscriptions) |
| Discount or free month | Price is a consideration factor |
| Gift cards | Universal; no product dependency |
| Charitable donation | Mission-aligned brands |
| Exclusive access / features | Strong community or product loyalty |
| Swag / physical gifts | Strong brand identity |

**Reward size:** The referral reward must feel meaningful but not feel like it's the only reason someone referred. Test different values; too high can attract fraudulent referrals.

### Referral Program Placement

Surface the referral program at peak satisfaction moments:
1. Right after signup / purchase ("You're in — know someone who'd love this?")
2. After first value moment / activation
3. After positive customer support interaction
4. Post-NPS survey (ask promoters to refer)
5. Account anniversary or usage milestone
6. In the product dashboard (persistent, low-friction)

## Word-of-Mouth Engineering

### Social Sharing Mechanics

Build sharing into the product / experience:
- **Milestone sharing:** "You just [milestone] — share it?" (Duolingo streaks, Spotify Wrapped)
- **Collaboration invites:** Features that require inviting others to get value (Figma, Notion)
- **Public profiles / portfolios:** User-generated content that links back to your product
- **Shareable outputs:** Reports, certificates, results that are worth sharing and carry your brand

### Testimonial & Review Collection

**When to ask:**
- After NPS score of 9-10 (strike when sentiment is highest)
- 30-60 days after successful onboarding
- After a meaningful outcome ("You just saved X hours" or "You hit Y milestone")
- After resolving a support issue well

**How to ask:**
> "Glad to hear [outcome]. Would you be willing to leave a quick review on G2? It would help others in your situation find us. Here's a link: [URL]"

**G2/Capterra review programs:**
- Email your NPS promoters with a direct link to your profile
- Use G2's Review Generation feature for structured campaigns
- Segment by customer tier: enterprise reviews are more valuable, so personalize outreach

### Making Content Shareable

- Create outputs people are proud to share (results, reports, certificates)
- Design for screenshotability — ensure your product UI looks good at 1080x1080
- Add social sharing buttons to result pages, milestone celebrations, achievements
- "Powered by [Brand]" on white-labeled or collaborative outputs

## Referral Program Operations

### Fraud Prevention
- Limit to one referral code per account
- Require referred user to complete qualifying action before reward is granted (e.g., 30-day paid plan)
- Monitor for self-referral (same payment method, same IP)
- Hold rewards for fraud review period

### Referral Email Sequence (to referrer)
1. Confirmation: "Your referral link is ready — here it is"
2. Reminder (Day 7): "You've made 0 referrals — here's how to get started"
3. Social proof: "Other customers have earned $X — here's how"
4. Milestone celebration: "You've referred 3 people — 2 more for [reward]"
5. Thank you: "Your referral converted — reward is on the way"

## Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Viral coefficient (K-factor) | Avg referrals per customer × conversion rate |
| Referral signup rate | % of referred visitors who sign up |
| Referral-to-paid conversion | Quality of referred customers |
| Referral channel contribution | % of total signups from referral |
| CAC via referral | Usually 2-5× lower than paid acquisition |
| Referral program participation rate | % of customers who refer at least once |
| LTV of referred customers | Usually 16-25% higher than average |
