# Retention & Lifecycle Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**Lincoln Murphy — Customer Success**
Murphy's foundational insight: churn is decided *during* onboarding, not at renewal. Customer success = desired outcome + appropriate experience. The "aha moment" (when a customer first realizes the product's value) must happen as fast as possible. Health scoring — measuring the signals that predict retention — is the CS team's primary tool.

**David Skok — SaaS Metrics That Matter**
Skok's SaaS lifecycle model identifies the key financial metrics of retention: NRR (Net Revenue Retention), GRR (Gross Revenue Retention), and CAC payback period. A business with >100% NRR grows without adding a single new customer because expansion revenue from existing customers exceeds churn. Target NRR: >110% for strong SaaS businesses.


Acquiring a new customer costs 5-7× more than retaining an existing one. A 5% improvement in retention increases profits by 25-95% (Bain & Company). Retention is the highest-leverage thing most marketing teams ignore.

**The retention mindset shift:** Customers don't churn because they're disloyal. They churn because they didn't achieve the outcome they expected, or because a better alternative appeared at the right moment.

## Customer Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Definition | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| New | Just signed up / purchased | Activate to first value moment |
| Onboarding | Learning the product | Build habits, demonstrate ROI |
| Active | Regular, engaged usage | Expand, build loyalty |
| At-Risk | Usage declining | Re-engage before churn |
| Churned | Cancelled / lapsed | Win back |
| Advocate | Promoter (NPS 9-10) | Referrals, reviews, case studies |

## Onboarding for Retention

The onboarding experience determines long-term retention more than any other factor.

### Onboarding Framework
1. **Define the Aha Moment:** The moment a new user realizes the product's core value. Everything in onboarding should drive toward this.
2. **Remove friction:** Every extra step between signup and aha moment costs you users
3. **Celebrate progress:** Acknowledge each milestone to build momentum
4. **Set expectations:** Communicate what they'll get and when

### Onboarding Email Sequence (7-14 days)
- Email 1 (Day 0 - Immediate): Welcome + what to do first (direct to aha moment)
- Email 2 (Day 1): Did you complete step 1? Here's why it matters.
- Email 3 (Day 3): Helpful tip / second-most important feature
- Email 4 (Day 7): Check-in + social proof (what successful users do)
- Email 5 (Day 14): Review or case study of someone achieving the outcome they want

### Activation Metrics
- % of new users who complete onboarding checklist
- Time to aha moment
- Day 7 retention rate
- Feature adoption rate (key features correlated with retention)

## Churn Prevention

### Churn Prediction Signals
Build an early warning system. Leading indicators of churn:
- **Usage:** Login frequency drops, key features unused
- **Engagement:** Emails not opened, no support interactions
- **Health signals:** Feature adoption below benchmark for their stage
- **External:** Billing failure, decision-maker leaves company
- **Behavioral:** Exported data, visited cancellation page, contacted competitor

### Intervention Strategies by Segment

**Low-touch intervention (1:many):**
- Automated re-engagement emails triggered by inactivity
- In-product nudges and tips
- Win-back email sequence

**Mid-touch intervention (proactive CS):**
- CS team alert when account health drops below threshold
- Proactive check-in call
- Personalized tips based on their use case

**High-touch intervention (save sequence):**
- Executive outreach for high-value accounts
- Custom success plan
- Discount or extended trial offer (last resort)

### Cancellation Flow Optimization
When a user initiates cancellation:
- Ask for reason (data for product team + opens conversation)
- Offer relevant alternative: pause, downgrade, or help with their stated concern
- If they still cancel: immediate survey, future win-back sequence

## Upsell & Cross-Sell

### When to Upsell
Best upsell timing = moments of peak value:
- After they achieve a key milestone
- When they're hitting limits of current plan
- After a positive support interaction
- When usage patterns suggest they'd benefit from a higher tier

### Upsell Email Framework
1. Observe the trigger: "You've done X [milestone]"
2. Bridge to the next level: "Customers at this stage typically unlock [result] with [feature]"
3. Make the pitch: "Here's how [upgrade] would help you"
4. Reduce friction: "I'd love to show you — book 15 minutes"

### Cross-Sell
- Only cross-sell after the customer has achieved success with the core product
- Frame as "the logical next step" based on what they're trying to accomplish
- Use customer success stories from similar customers

## Win-Back Campaigns

Segment churned customers:
- **Recently churned (0-30 days):** Highest win-back probability; lead with direct ask + acknowledgment
- **Mid-term churned (30-180 days):** Share what's improved since they left; offer incentive
- **Long-term churned (180+ days):** Treat almost like a new lead; product has changed significantly

### Win-Back Email Sequence (3-4 emails over 30 days)
1. "We miss you" — personal, acknowledge they left, share 1 improvement
2. "What changed" — specific feature or product update relevant to their use case
3. "Special offer" — time-limited incentive (discount, extended trial, bonus features)
4. "Last chance" + breakup — final outreach, no pressure, leave the door open

## Loyalty & Advocacy Programs

Turn satisfied customers into advocates:
- **NPS trigger:** Email customers who score 9-10 within 24 hours to ask for review or referral
- **Milestone celebration:** Mark anniversary dates, usage milestones, outcomes achieved
- **Exclusive access:** Beta features, community, events — customers love insider status
- **Case study pipeline:** Build systematic process for capturing customer success stories

## Retention Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Churn rate (monthly) | Lost customers / Total customers | < 2% (SaaS), < 5% (SMB SaaS) |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | (Starting MRR + expansion - churn) / Starting MRR | > 100% is good; > 120% is great |
| Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) | (Starting MRR - churn) / Starting MRR | > 85% |
| Customer LTV | ARPU × Gross margin / Churn rate | > 3× CAC |
| Day 1/7/30 retention | % of cohort active after N days | Depends on product type |
| NPS | Promoter % - Detractor % | > 40 is good; > 60 is excellent |
