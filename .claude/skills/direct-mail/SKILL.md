# Direct Mail

## Core Philosophy

Direct mail gets a pass through the spam filter. Physical mail has 90%+ open rates, is held for an average of 17 days, and faces virtually zero competition in the mailbox for B2B audiences. In a digital-saturated world, a well-timed physical piece stands out precisely because it's unexpected.

**When direct mail wins:** High-value accounts (ABM), re-engagement of lapsed customers, post-trade-show follow-up, executive outreach, and luxury/high-consideration B2C products.

## When to Use Direct Mail

**High ROI scenarios:**
- ABM campaigns targeting named enterprise accounts (100-500 accounts)
- Executive-level outreach where email gets filtered by assistants
- Win-back campaigns for churned high-value customers
- Post-event follow-up (trade show, conference)
- Customer gifting and loyalty programs
- High-end B2C (real estate, luxury, financial services)

**Lower ROI scenarios:**
- Broad awareness campaigns (cost per impression is high vs. digital)
- Cold outreach to poorly qualified lists

## Direct Mail Formats

| Format | Use Case | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Postcard | Announcements, promotions, event invites | $ (lowest) |
| Letter + envelope | Personalized outreach, premium feel | $$ |
| Self-mailer / brochure | Product showcase, catalog | $$ |
| Dimensional mail (box, package) | ABM, high-value accounts, gifting | $$$+ |
| Handwritten note | Personal touch for relationships | $$-$$$ |
| Gift + note | Executive outreach, customer appreciation | $$$$+ |

**For ABM:** Dimensional mail (sending something 3D like a branded box, a relevant book, a personalized item) has response rates 5-10× higher than flat mail.

## Targeting & List Building

### List Sources
- **Your CRM:** Best quality — these people know you
- **Trade show / event attendee lists:** Recent engagement signal
- **Third-party data providers:** InfoUSA, Data.com, Melissa Data, USPS OOTB
- **Account lists for ABM:** Build from target account list + find shipping addresses

### Targeting Variables
- Job title and seniority
- Industry and company size
- Geography
- Recent buying signals or lifecycle stage
- CRM data (lapsed customers, high-value prospects, churned accounts)

### NCOA Compliance
If using any list that's 6+ months old, run it through NCOA (National Change of Address) to update addresses. Reduces undeliverable mail and wasted spend.

## Personalization

The more personal the mail feels, the higher the response rate.

**Personalization levels:**
1. **Name + company:** Minimum bar
2. **Role-specific message:** Adapt copy by job title or persona
3. **Account-specific:** Reference their company, recent news, or challenge
4. **Hyper-personalized:** Handwritten elements, custom content per recipient

**Variable data printing (VDP):** Modern print services can personalize each piece with unique text, images, QR codes, and offers at scale. Use for segments of 50+.

## Copy Principles for Direct Mail

**Outer envelope / packaging:**
- Must create curiosity or promise immediate value to be opened
- Handwritten addressing outperforms printed labels
- "Do Not Forward" or official-looking envelopes have high open rates (use carefully)

**Letter format (if sending a letter):**
- Headline or teaser at top of letter
- Personal opener: "I'm reaching out because..."
- One clear problem you solve
- One clear proof point (stat, customer story)
- One clear CTA with specific instructions
- P.S. line — second most-read element of a letter after the headline

**Call to action options:**
- URL with UTM parameter (track digital attribution)
- Personalized landing page (PURL) with pre-filled info
- QR code to a specific page
- Phone number
- Reply card or tear-off

## Integrating with Digital

Direct mail converts best when connected to digital:

**Sequence idea (for ABM):**
1. LinkedIn connection from SDR
2. Targeted LinkedIn ad (account matched)
3. Direct mail piece arrives
4. Email follow-up references the mail: "Did you get the [item] we sent?"
5. SDR call with specific reference to mail piece

**Attribution:**
- Use unique URLs, QR codes, or phone numbers per mail campaign
- Match mailing list to CRM to track pipeline influence
- For B2C: unique offer codes per mail piece

## Budget & Economics

| Format | Cost per Piece (all-in) |
|---|---|
| Postcard | $0.50-1.50 |
| Letter / envelope | $1-3 |
| Brochure / self-mailer | $2-5 |
| Dimensional / gift box (100 units) | $25-75+ |

**ABM direct mail ROI calculation:**
- Cost: 100 accounts × $50/piece = $5,000
- Response rate: 10-20% = 10-20 meetings
- Close rate: 20% = 2-4 closed deals
- Deal size: $20,000+ = ROI clear if 1 deal closes

**Production + fulfillment vendors:** Sendoso (digital + physical gifting platform), Postal.io, PFL, MOO (print), VistaPrint (budget), local printers for custom runs.
