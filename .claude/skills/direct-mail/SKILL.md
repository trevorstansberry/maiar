# Direct Mail

## Core Philosophy

Direct mail gets a pass through the spam filter. Physical mail has 90%+ open rates, is held for an average of 17 days, and faces virtually zero competition in the mailbox for B2B audiences. In a digital-saturated world, a well-timed physical piece stands out precisely because it's unexpected.

**When direct mail wins:** High-value accounts (ABM), re-engagement of lapsed customers, post-trade-show follow-up, executive outreach, and luxury/high-consideration B2C products.


## Expert Foundations

**Dan Kennedy — No B.S. Direct Marketing**
Kennedy's direct marketing laws: every piece of direct mail must have a clear offer, a deadline, and a specific call to action. "Awareness" mail without an offer is a donation to the postal service. The three pillars: right list (50% of results) + right offer (30%) + right copy (20%). Most marketers over-invest in copy and under-invest in list quality.

**Direct Marketing Association Research**
DMA data: direct mail achieves a 4.4% average response rate vs. 0.12% for email. But the economics only work with a compelling offer and a targeted list. The response rate number is meaningless without response rate × average order value × margin.

### Direct Mail in the Modern Marketing Mix

Direct mail works because:
- Physical mail gets attention in a digital-saturated environment
- Personalization at scale is easy (variable data printing)
- In B2B, a package to a VP's office gets past the email filter
- Stays around — mail sits on desks; email gets deleted

### List Selection (50% of Success)

**B2B list sources:**
- CRM export — existing contacts who haven't engaged digitally
- Intent data platforms (Bombora, 6sense) — companies actively researching your category
- Apollo / ZoomInfo — title, company size, geography targeting
- Account list (ABM tie-in) — your top 50-200 target accounts

**B2C list sources:**
- Existing customers (highest response rate — already trust you)
- Lookalike lists from list brokers (match your best customers)
- Compiled lists by geography / demographics / purchase history

**List hygiene rule:** Never mail a list you haven't validated in 12 months. Return mail rates above 10% tank deliverability scores and waste budget.

### Offer Construction

An irresistible direct mail offer has:
1. **Clear value:** What they get, specifically
2. **Reason to act now:** Deadline, limited quantity, time-sensitive discount
3. **Low friction:** One action to take, not three

**Offer types that work:**
- Free consultation / discovery call (B2B)
- Free sample or trial kit (product)
- Discount code with expiration date
- Invitation to an exclusive event
- Free report or research study

### Format Selection

| Format | Best For | Typical Cost/Piece |
|---|---|---|
| Postcard | Announcement, promotion, event | $0.50-1.50 |
| Letter package | Complex offer, relationship-building | $2-5 |
| Lumpy mail (3D package) | High-value account, ABM, executive | $25-75 |
| Catalog | E-commerce, product line | $3-10 |
| Self-mailer | Simple message, high volume | $1-3 |

### Response Tracking

Every direct mail campaign needs a unique response path:
- Unique landing page URL per campaign
- Unique phone number (call tracking)
- QR code with UTM parameters
- Personalized URL (PURL) per recipient
- Unique promo code

**Minimum tracking metrics:** Response rate, cost per response, cost per conversion, revenue attributable

## When to Use Direct Mail

**High ROI scenarios:**
- ABM campaigns targeting named enterprise accounts (100-500 accounts)
- Executive-level outreach where email gets filtered by assistants
- Win-back campaigns for churned high-value customers
- Post-event follow-up (trade show, conference)
- Customer gifting and loyalty programs
- High-end B2C (real estate, luxury, financial services)

**Lower ROI scenarios:**
- Broad awareness campaigns (cost per impression is high vs. digital)
- Cold outreach to poorly qualified lists

## Direct Mail Formats

| Format | Use Case | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Postcard | Announcements, promotions, event invites | $ (lowest) |
| Letter + envelope | Personalized outreach, premium feel | $$ |
| Self-mailer / brochure | Product showcase, catalog | $$ |
| Dimensional mail (box, package) | ABM, high-value accounts, gifting | $$$+ |
| Handwritten note | Personal touch for relationships | $$-$$$ |
| Gift + note | Executive outreach, customer appreciation | $$$$+ |

**For ABM:** Dimensional mail (sending something 3D like a branded box, a relevant book, a personalized item) has response rates 5-10× higher than flat mail.

## Targeting & List Building

### List Sources
- **Your CRM:** Best quality — these people know you
- **Trade show / event attendee lists:** Recent engagement signal
- **Third-party data providers:** InfoUSA, Data.com, Melissa Data, USPS OOTB
- **Account lists for ABM:** Build from target account list + find shipping addresses

### Targeting Variables
- Job title and seniority
- Industry and company size
- Geography
- Recent buying signals or lifecycle stage
- CRM data (lapsed customers, high-value prospects, churned accounts)

### NCOA Compliance
If using any list that's 6+ months old, run it through NCOA (National Change of Address) to update addresses. Reduces undeliverable mail and wasted spend.

## Personalization

The more personal the mail feels, the higher the response rate.

**Personalization levels:**
1. **Name + company:** Minimum bar
2. **Role-specific message:** Adapt copy by job title or persona
3. **Account-specific:** Reference their company, recent news, or challenge
4. **Hyper-personalized:** Handwritten elements, custom content per recipient

**Variable data printing (VDP):** Modern print services can personalize each piece with unique text, images, QR codes, and offers at scale. Use for segments of 50+.

## Copy Principles for Direct Mail

**Outer envelope / packaging:**
- Must create curiosity or promise immediate value to be opened
- Handwritten addressing outperforms printed labels
- "Do Not Forward" or official-looking envelopes have high open rates (use carefully)

**Letter format (if sending a letter):**
- Headline or teaser at top of letter
- Personal opener: "I'm reaching out because..."
- One clear problem you solve
- One clear proof point (stat, customer story)
- One clear CTA with specific instructions
- P.S. line — second most-read element of a letter after the headline

**Call to action options:**
- URL with UTM parameter (track digital attribution)
- Personalized landing page (PURL) with pre-filled info
- QR code to a specific page
- Phone number
- Reply card or tear-off

## Integrating with Digital

Direct mail converts best when connected to digital:

**Sequence idea (for ABM):**
1. LinkedIn connection from SDR
2. Targeted LinkedIn ad (account matched)
3. Direct mail piece arrives
4. Email follow-up references the mail: "Did you get the [item] we sent?"
5. SDR call with specific reference to mail piece

**Attribution:**
- Use unique URLs, QR codes, or phone numbers per mail campaign
- Match mailing list to CRM to track pipeline influence
- For B2C: unique offer codes per mail piece

## Budget & Economics

| Format | Cost per Piece (all-in) |
|---|---|
| Postcard | $0.50-1.50 |
| Letter / envelope | $1-3 |
| Brochure / self-mailer | $2-5 |
| Dimensional / gift box (100 units) | $25-75+ |

**ABM direct mail ROI calculation:**
- Cost: 100 accounts × $50/piece = $5,000
- Response rate: 10-20% = 10-20 meetings
- Close rate: 20% = 2-4 closed deals
- Deal size: $20,000+ = ROI clear if 1 deal closes

**Production + fulfillment vendors:** Sendoso (digital + physical gifting platform), Postal.io, PFL, MOO (print), VistaPrint (budget), local printers for custom runs.
