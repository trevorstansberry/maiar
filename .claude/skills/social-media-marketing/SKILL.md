# Social Media Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Social media is a distribution and relationship channel, not a billboard. The brands that win on social are those that show up consistently with genuine value, engage in real conversations, and have a distinct point of view — not those that post the most ads or chase every trend.

**Platform selection principle:** Be excellent on 1-2 platforms rather than mediocre on 5.

## Platform Guide

### LinkedIn
**Best for:** B2B companies, thought leadership, professional services, recruiting
**Content that works:** Personal stories with business lessons, original insights, contrarian takes, data and research, case studies, team culture
**Format performance:** Text posts > Articles > Documents > Videos > Polls
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/week; best days Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 5-6pm
**Algorithm note:** Comments drive distribution more than likes; long-form text (1,300+ chars) consistently outperforms short posts

### Twitter / X
**Best for:** Real-time commentary, thought leadership, developer/tech communities, news-reactive content, community building
**Content that works:** Hot takes, threads with original insights, commentary on trending topics, quick tips, "unpopular opinion" formats
**Format performance:** Threads > Single tweets with images > Polls > Plain text
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/day for high growth; 1-2x/day for brand accounts
**Algorithm note:** Engagement in first 30 minutes matters most for distribution

### Instagram
**Best for:** Visual brands, B2C, lifestyle, food/fashion/design, creator partnerships
**Content that works:** High-quality visuals, behind-the-scenes, user-generated content, educational carousels, Reels
**Format performance:** Reels > Carousels > Single images > Stories
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/week; Stories daily
**Algorithm note:** Reels get the most reach; carousels get the most saves and revisits

### TikTok
**Best for:** B2C, younger demographics, high-entertainment content, trending audio
**Content that works:** Educational content with entertainment, behind-the-scenes, trend participation, creator collabs
**Format performance:** Original audio > Trending audio; tutorials and "POV" formats perform well
**Optimal posting:** 1-3x/day for growth phase
**Algorithm note:** Watch time is the primary signal; hooks must land in first 2-3 seconds

### YouTube
**Best for:** Long-form education, product demos, case studies, thought leadership, SEO via video
**Content that works:** Tutorials, deep dives, interviews, product walkthroughs
**Format performance:** Long-form (8-15 min) for search; Shorts for discovery
**Optimal posting:** 1-2x/week (consistency > frequency)
**Algorithm note:** Watch percentage and click-through rate from thumbnails are primary signals

### Facebook
**Best for:** Local businesses, B2C, community groups, older demographics, paid advertising
**Content that works:** Groups, events, video, curated content
**Organic reach:** Very low for pages — invest in groups and paid over organic page posts

## Content Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule for Social
- 80% value (educational, entertaining, inspiring, useful)
- 20% promotional (products, features, case studies)

### Content Pillars for Social
Pick 3-5 content themes to own consistently. Examples:
- "Behind the scenes" — how things get made
- "Hot takes" — contrarian or provocative industry views
- "Teach the thing" — practical how-to content
- "Customer wins" — social proof in story form
- "Company culture" — who we are, what we believe

### Post Anatomy
1. **Hook** (line 1): Must stop the scroll — question, bold claim, surprising stat, or story opening
2. **Body:** Deliver the promised value concisely
3. **CTA:** Tell them what to do next (comment, save, link in bio)

## Community Management

### Engagement Rules
- Respond to every comment within 24 hours for the first week after posting (boosts algorithm)
- Ask questions in posts to seed comments
- Engage with others' content in your niche — strategic commenting builds visibility
- Handle complaints publicly first, then move to DMs

### Social Listening
Monitor:
- Brand mentions (with and without @handle)
- Competitor mentions
- Industry keywords and hashtags
- Sentiment trends

Tools: Sprout Social, Brandwatch, Mention, native platform notifications

## Social Media Calendar

### Weekly Cadence Template
| Day | Platform | Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | LinkedIn | Original insight or take |
| Tuesday | Instagram | Educational carousel or Reel |
| Wednesday | Twitter/X | Thread or commentary |
| Thursday | LinkedIn | Case study or social proof |
| Friday | All | Behind-the-scenes or team culture |

Batch-create content 1-2 weeks ahead. Use scheduling tools (Buffer, Later, Hootsuite, Sprout Social).

## Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Reach / Impressions | Awareness and distribution |
| Follower growth rate | Audience building |
| Engagement rate | Content resonance (engagements / reach) |
| Save rate | Content value (saves = bookmarks) |
| Share rate | Virality and advocacy |
| Profile visits | Interest conversion |
| Link clicks | Traffic driving |
| Mentions | Brand awareness and conversation volume |

**Benchmark engagement rates:**
- Micro-accounts (<10K): 3-6% is healthy
- Mid-size (10K-100K): 1-3%
- Large (100K+): 0.5-1.5%

## Common Mistakes

- Posting the same content across all platforms without adapting format
- Focusing on follower count instead of engagement rate
- No consistent posting schedule — algorithms penalize inconsistency
- Ignoring comments and DMs
- Treating social as a megaphone instead of a conversation
