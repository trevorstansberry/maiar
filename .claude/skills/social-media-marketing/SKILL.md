# Social Media Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**Gary Vaynerchuk — Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook**
Give value relentlessly before asking for anything. "Jabs" are helpful, entertaining, or educational content. "Right hooks" are asks (buy, sign up, share). Most brands throw too many right hooks without earning the relationship first. Platform-native content — content that feels like it belongs on that platform, not repurposed from elsewhere — always outperforms.

**Jay Baer — Youtility**
The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing. Youtility is marketing so useful, people would pay for it. Social media content that genuinely helps your audience creates the deepest brand affinity — not content that simply promotes your product. Ask: "Is this content useful enough that someone would seek it out even if we weren't selling anything?"


Social media is a distribution and relationship channel, not a billboard. The brands that win on social are those that show up consistently with genuine value, engage in real conversations, and have a distinct point of view — not those that post the most ads or chase every trend.

**Platform selection principle:** Be excellent on 1-2 platforms rather than mediocre on 5.

## Platform Guide

### LinkedIn
**Best for:** B2B companies, thought leadership, professional services, recruiting
**Content that works:** Personal stories with business lessons, original insights, contrarian takes, data and research, case studies, team culture
**Format performance:** Text posts > Articles > Documents > Videos > Polls
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/week; best days Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 5-6pm
**Algorithm note:** Comments drive distribution more than likes; long-form text (1,300+ chars) consistently outperforms short posts

### Twitter / X
**Best for:** Real-time commentary, thought leadership, developer/tech communities, news-reactive content, community building
**Content that works:** Hot takes, threads with original insights, commentary on trending topics, quick tips, "unpopular opinion" formats
**Format performance:** Threads > Single tweets with images > Polls > Plain text
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/day for high growth; 1-2x/day for brand accounts
**Algorithm note:** Engagement in first 30 minutes matters most for distribution

### Instagram
**Best for:** Visual brands, B2C, lifestyle, food/fashion/design, creator partnerships
**Content that works:** High-quality visuals, behind-the-scenes, user-generated content, educational carousels, Reels
**Format performance:** Reels > Carousels > Single images > Stories
**Optimal posting:** 3-5x/week; Stories daily
**Algorithm note:** Reels get the most reach; carousels get the most saves and revisits

### TikTok
**Best for:** B2C, younger demographics, high-entertainment content, trending audio
**Content that works:** Educational content with entertainment, behind-the-scenes, trend participation, creator collabs
**Format performance:** Original audio > Trending audio; tutorials and "POV" formats perform well
**Optimal posting:** 1-3x/day for growth phase
**Algorithm note:** Watch time is the primary signal; hooks must land in first 2-3 seconds

### YouTube
**Best for:** Long-form education, product demos, case studies, thought leadership, SEO via video
**Content that works:** Tutorials, deep dives, interviews, product walkthroughs
**Format performance:** Long-form (8-15 min) for search; Shorts for discovery
**Optimal posting:** 1-2x/week (consistency > frequency)
**Algorithm note:** Watch percentage and click-through rate from thumbnails are primary signals

### Facebook
**Best for:** Local businesses, B2C, community groups, older demographics, paid advertising
**Content that works:** Groups, events, video, curated content
**Organic reach:** Very low for pages — invest in groups and paid over organic page posts

## Content Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule for Social
- 80% value (educational, entertaining, inspiring, useful)
- 20% promotional (products, features, case studies)

### Content Pillars for Social
Pick 3-5 content themes to own consistently. Examples:
- "Behind the scenes" — how things get made
- "Hot takes" — contrarian or provocative industry views
- "Teach the thing" — practical how-to content
- "Customer wins" — social proof in story form
- "Company culture" — who we are, what we believe

### Post Anatomy
1. **Hook** (line 1): Must stop the scroll — question, bold claim, surprising stat, or story opening
2. **Body:** Deliver the promised value concisely
3. **CTA:** Tell them what to do next (comment, save, link in bio)

## Community Management

### Engagement Rules
- Respond to every comment within 24 hours for the first week after posting (boosts algorithm)
- Ask questions in posts to seed comments
- Engage with others' content in your niche — strategic commenting builds visibility
- Handle complaints publicly first, then move to DMs

### Social Listening
Monitor:
- Brand mentions (with and without @handle)
- Competitor mentions
- Industry keywords and hashtags
- Sentiment trends

Tools: Sprout Social, Brandwatch, Mention, native platform notifications

## Social Media Calendar

### Weekly Cadence Template
| Day | Platform | Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | LinkedIn | Original insight or take |
| Tuesday | Instagram | Educational carousel or Reel |
| Wednesday | Twitter/X | Thread or commentary |
| Thursday | LinkedIn | Case study or social proof |
| Friday | All | Behind-the-scenes or team culture |

Batch-create content 1-2 weeks ahead. Use scheduling tools (Buffer, Later, Hootsuite, Sprout Social).

## Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Reach / Impressions | Awareness and distribution |
| Follower growth rate | Audience building |
| Engagement rate | Content resonance (engagements / reach) |
| Save rate | Content value (saves = bookmarks) |
| Share rate | Virality and advocacy |
| Profile visits | Interest conversion |
| Link clicks | Traffic driving |
| Mentions | Brand awareness and conversation volume |

**Benchmark engagement rates:**
- Micro-accounts (<10K): 3-6% is healthy
- Mid-size (10K-100K): 1-3%
- Large (100K+): 0.5-1.5%

## Common Mistakes

- Posting the same content across all platforms without adapting format
- Focusing on follower count instead of engagement rate
- No consistent posting schedule — algorithms penalize inconsistency
- Ignoring comments and DMs
- Treating social as a megaphone instead of a conversation
