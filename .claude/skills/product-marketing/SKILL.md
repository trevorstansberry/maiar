# Product Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Product marketing is the connective tissue between product, sales, and the market. It answers: Who is this for? What problem does it solve? Why are we the best answer? And how do we communicate that in a way that resonates with the right buyer?

**Product marketing's job:** Help the right people understand why this product is exactly right for them.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Positioning:** Defining where the product sits in the market relative to alternatives
2. **Messaging:** Translating positioning into words that resonate with buyers
3. **GTM strategy:** Planning how new products and features reach the market
4. **Launch:** Coordinating internal and external launch execution
5. **Competitive intelligence:** Tracking competitors and enabling sales to win competitive deals
6. **Sales enablement:** Equipping sales with tools and knowledge to sell effectively

## Positioning Framework

### Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Template
"For [target customer] who [has this need or problem], [product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit/differentiation]. Unlike [primary competitor or alternative], our product [key differentiator]."

### Positioning Process
1. **Customer research:** Understand how customers describe the problem and your solution in their words (interviews, reviews, support tickets)
2. **Competitive landscape:** Map alternatives — direct competitors, indirect competitors, "do nothing"
3. **Identify the frame:** What category do you want to be compared in? (You choose this)
4. **Differentiation:** What is genuinely different, provably better, and defensible?
5. **Validate:** Test messaging with customers before full rollout

### Where Positioning Goes Wrong
- Positioning to everyone means positioning to no one
- Differentiating on features that get copied in 6 months
- Claiming the same position as the market leader (you'll always lose that comparison)
- Positioning based on what you wish were true, not what customers confirm

## Messaging Architecture

### Messaging Hierarchy
```
Core Brand Promise (one sentence that captures everything)
    ↓
Value Proposition (why you're the best choice for your ICP)
    ↓
Proof Points (evidence that the value prop is real)
    ↓
Feature-Benefit Statements (specific capabilities + outcomes)
    ↓
Objection Handlers (responses to common concerns)
```

### Audience-Specific Messaging

Different stakeholders need different messages:

| Audience | What They Care About |
|---|---|
| CEO/Executive | Strategic outcomes, competitive risk, ROI |
| Department Head | Team productivity, visibility, accountability |
| End User | Ease of use, time saved, less frustration |
| IT/Security | Security, compliance, integrations |
| Procurement | Price, terms, vendor stability |

Create a messaging matrix with one key message + one proof point per audience.

## Product Launch Planning

### Launch Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Time to Plan |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (Major) | New product, major feature, category announcement | 3-6 months |
| Tier 2 (Significant) | Meaningful feature, integration, package change | 4-8 weeks |
| Tier 3 (Minor) | Small feature, improvement, bug fix with PR value | 1-2 weeks |
| Tier 4 (Silent) | Internal improvement, no external announcement | No plan needed |

### Launch Plan Template

**Objective:** What outcome are we driving with this launch?
**Target audience:** Who needs to know, and who will care?
**Key message:** One sentence that captures what's new and why it matters
**Launch date:** Target date + who approves it

**Channels:**
- Email: What goes to customers vs. prospects?
- Blog: Announcement post (long) + feature description
- Social: Platform-specific content plan
- In-product: In-app notification or banner
- Sales: Briefing date + talk track
- PR: Any press outreach? Customer quotes available?
- Partner: Partner enablement if relevant

**Metrics:** How will we measure success 30/60/90 days post-launch?

## Competitive Intelligence

### Competitive Monitoring

Track competitors continuously:
- G2 and Capterra reviews (read theirs, not just yours)
- Their blog and content (topics signal priorities)
- LinkedIn job postings (reveals what they're building)
- Product changelogs and release notes
- Social media and community
- News mentions and funding announcements
- Sales team win/loss feedback

### Competitive Battlecard Format
One card per competitor:

1. **Quick summary:** Who they are in 2 sentences
2. **Where they win:** Honest assessment of where they beat you
3. **Where we win:** Specific differentiation points with proof
4. **Their pitch:** How they typically describe themselves
5. **Our counter-pitch:** How to reframe the comparison
6. **Qualifying questions:** Questions to reveal where you win
7. **Landmines to avoid:** Things to not bring up that help their case
8. **Customer proof:** Case studies against this competitor

## Sales Enablement Assets

- **One-pager:** Customer-facing; one page, problem/solution/proof
