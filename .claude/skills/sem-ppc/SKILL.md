# Search Engine Marketing (SEM / PPC)

## Core Philosophy

SEM puts your message in front of people at the exact moment they're searching for what you offer. Unlike social ads (interruption-based), search ads intercept existing demand. The key to SEM success is matching intent precisely, then converting efficiently.

**The SEM equation:** Right keyword + Right ad + Right landing page = Profitable conversion


## Expert Foundations

**Perry Marshall — 80/20 Sales and Marketing**
Marshall's SEM insight: in any Google Ads account, 20% of keywords drive 80% of profit. The discipline is identifying those 20% early and ruthlessly cutting everything else. Most advertisers run 5x more keywords than they should. Clean accounts outperform bloated ones — fewer keywords, tighter ad groups, more relevant ads = higher Quality Score = lower CPCs.

**Brad Geddes — Advanced Google Ads**
Geddes's framework for account structure: organize by intent, not by product. A visitor searching "buy [product]" vs. "[product] review" vs. "how to [problem]" has radically different intent — and needs a different ad, different landing page, and different bid. One ad group for all three is the most common structural mistake in SEM.

### Keyword Intent Tiers

Every search query has an intent signal. Structure campaigns around intent:

| Intent Tier | Query Pattern | Bid Strategy | Landing Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| High (buy now) | "[product] price", "buy [product]", "[brand] vs [competitor]" | Aggressive — maximize share | Demo / pricing / free trial |
| Mid (evaluate) | "best [product]", "[product] review", "[problem] solution" | Moderate — capture consideration | Feature page / comparison / guide |
| Low (learn) | "how to [problem]", "what is [concept]" | Low or exclude | Educational content / top-of-funnel |

### Match Types

| Match Type | What It Matches | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Exact `[keyword]` | Only that exact query | High-value, high-intent terms |
| Phrase `"keyword"` | Queries containing that phrase | Controlled expansion around proven terms |
| Broad match `keyword` | Google's interpretation — broad | Only with Smart Bidding + strong negative list |

**Rule:** Start exact and phrase. Use broad only after you have conversion data and a comprehensive negative keyword list.

### Quality Score Levers

Quality Score (1-10) determines your ad rank and cost. Three factors:

1. **Expected CTR** — Is your ad likely to get clicked? (Ad copy matters here)
2. **Ad relevance** — How closely does your ad match the search query? (Tight ad groups matter here)
3. **Landing page experience** — Does your page deliver what the ad promised? (Message match matters here)

**Improving QS by 1 point can reduce CPC by 16-50%** (Google data).

### Account Structure Principles

- **Tight ad groups:** 5-20 keywords per ad group maximum; one theme per group
- **Message match:** Ad headline must match the keyword + landing page headline must match the ad
- **Negative keywords:** Build a negative list before launch; expand weekly from search term reports
- **Bidding strategy:** Manual CPC while learning; switch to Target CPA/ROAS once you have 30+ conversions in 30 days

### Budget Allocation Rule

Start with a "learning budget" — enough spend to get statistical significance before optimizing:
- Minimum: 5-10x your target CPA per month to learn
- Example: Target CPA $100 → $500-1,000/month minimum to optimize effectively

### SEM vs. SEO

| Factor | SEM (Paid) | SEO (Organic) |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | Immediate — live within hours | Months to rank |
| Cost | Pay per click | Time + content investment |
| Control | Full control over messaging | Limited control |
| Long-term | Traffic stops when budget stops | Traffic compounds over time |
| Best use | High-intent, buying-stage queries | Informational, research-stage queries |

*Run both: SEM for immediate conversion capture; SEO for long-term compounding reach.*

## Account Structure

### Campaign Hierarchy
```
Account
└── Campaign (budget, network, location, bid strategy)
    └── Ad Group (keyword theme, bids)
        └── Ads (headlines, descriptions)
        └── Keywords
```

**Best practice:** One clear theme per ad group; 10-20 tightly related keywords per ad group.

### Campaign Types
- **Search:** Text ads triggered by keyword queries (highest intent)
- **Shopping:** Product listings for e-commerce
- **Display:** Banner/visual ads across Google's network (awareness)
- **Performance Max:** Automated multi-channel (use once search is profitable)
- **YouTube:** Video ads (awareness + consideration)

## Keyword Strategy

### Match Types
| Match Type | Behavior | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| Exact [keyword] | Only exact phrase or close variants | High-volume, proven converters |
| Phrase "keyword" | Phrase present with words before/after | Exploring variations of core keywords |
| Broad keyword | Google's interpretation of relevance | Discovery, use with Smart Bidding only |

### Keyword Tiers by Intent

**Tier 1 — High Intent (convert now):**
- "[product/service] + buy/pricing/near me/cost"
- Brand keywords
- Competitor keywords (bid carefully)

**Tier 2 — Consideration (educate + convert):**
- "Best [product category]"
- "[Product] vs [competitor]"
- "[Problem] solution/tool/software"

**Tier 3 — Awareness (top of funnel):**
- Informational queries about the problem
- "How to [solve problem]"
- Generally lower ROI for direct conversion; better for display/YouTube

### Negative Keywords
Critical for preventing wasted spend. Build negative lists for:
- Irrelevant industries using the same terms
- Free/DIY intent ("free", "open source", "tutorial", "how to" — if not intent-matched)
- Wrong-tier roles or company sizes
- Competitor brand names (unless specifically bidding on them)

## Google Ads Copywriting

### Responsive Search Ads (RSA) Structure
- **Headlines:** 15 available (Google shows 3 at a time), 30 characters each
- **Descriptions:** 4 available (Google shows 2), 90 characters each
- **Approach:** Load all 15 headlines; Google tests combinations

**Headline formula (mix these):**
1. Primary keyword in headline
2. Key benefit (what they get)
3. Differentiator (why you're different)
4. Offer / CTA ("Get Free Quote", "Start Free Trial")
5. Social proof ("Trusted by 10,000+ Teams")
6. Urgency / scarcity ("Limited Spots Available")

### Quality Score Components
1. **Expected CTR** — Will searchers click this ad?
2. **Ad relevance** — Does the ad match the search intent?
3. **Landing page experience** — Does the LP deliver on the ad's promise?

Higher Quality Score = Lower CPCs + Better ad position. Aim for 7-10 on priority keywords.

### Ad Copy Principles
- Mirror the keyword in headline 1
- Highlight the unique benefit (not features — benefits)
- Include a clear CTA in every ad
- Test emotional vs. rational appeals
- Use ad extensions to take up more SERP real estate

## Ad Extensions (Assets)

Use all relevant extensions:
- **Sitelinks:** Link to other relevant pages (pricing, features, case studies)
- **Callouts:** Highlight benefits ("No credit card required", "24/7 support")
- **Structured snippets:** List features or service types
- **Call extension:** Phone number for service businesses
- **Lead form extension:** Capture leads directly from SERP
- **Price extension:** Show pricing tiers
- **Promotion extension:** Highlight offers

## Bidding Strategy

| Strategy | Use When |
|---|---|
| Manual CPC | Starting out — control costs, learn what works |
| Enhanced CPC | Semi-automated; good transitional strategy |
| Target CPA | Have 30+ conversions/month; know your target CPA |
| Target ROAS | Have 50+ conversions/month; e-commerce |
| Maximize Conversions | Want Google to spend budget efficiently (needs conversion data) |
| Maximize Clicks | Top of funnel / awareness campaigns |

## Budget Allocation Framework

- **Phase 1 (0-30 days):** Test with manual CPC; learn keyword performance
- **Phase 2 (30-90 days):** Shift winners to Smart Bidding; cut losers
- **Phase 3 (90+ days):** Scale winners; explore new keyword tiers

**Budget split:**
- 60-70% on proven, converting campaigns
- 20-30% on testing new keywords / ad variations
- 10% on competitive intelligence campaigns

## Landing Page Requirements

Search ads perform best when landing pages:
- Match headline/message exactly (message match)
- Load in under 3 seconds
- Have one primary CTA above the fold
- Include relevant social proof (logo wall, testimonials, G2 rating)
- No navigation links (removes exit paths)

## Campaign Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| CTR | Clicks / Impressions | > 3-5% for search |
| Quality Score | 1-10 relevance score | 7+ for priority keywords |
| CPC | Cost per click | Depends on industry |
| Conversion rate | Conversions / clicks | Depends on offer |
| CPA | Cost per acquisition | Must be below LTV |
| ROAS | Revenue / ad spend | 3x+ (e-commerce) |
| Impression share | % of available impressions won | > 60% for brand terms |

## Common Mistakes

- Sending all traffic to the homepage (kills conversion rates)
- Using only broad match keywords without Smart Bidding data
- Not building out negative keyword lists
- Setting it and forgetting it — SEM requires active management
- Measuring only clicks, not pipeline or revenue contribution
