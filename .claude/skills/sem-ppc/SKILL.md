# Search Engine Marketing (SEM / PPC)

## Core Philosophy

SEM puts your message in front of people at the exact moment they're searching for what you offer. Unlike social ads (interruption-based), search ads intercept existing demand. The key to SEM success is matching intent precisely, then converting efficiently.

**The SEM equation:** Right keyword + Right ad + Right landing page = Profitable conversion

## Account Structure

### Campaign Hierarchy
```
Account
└── Campaign (budget, network, location, bid strategy)
    └── Ad Group (keyword theme, bids)
        └── Ads (headlines, descriptions)
        └── Keywords
```

**Best practice:** One clear theme per ad group; 10-20 tightly related keywords per ad group.

### Campaign Types
- **Search:** Text ads triggered by keyword queries (highest intent)
- **Shopping:** Product listings for e-commerce
- **Display:** Banner/visual ads across Google's network (awareness)
- **Performance Max:** Automated multi-channel (use once search is profitable)
- **YouTube:** Video ads (awareness + consideration)

## Keyword Strategy

### Match Types
| Match Type | Behavior | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| Exact [keyword] | Only exact phrase or close variants | High-volume, proven converters |
| Phrase "keyword" | Phrase present with words before/after | Exploring variations of core keywords |
| Broad keyword | Google's interpretation of relevance | Discovery, use with Smart Bidding only |

### Keyword Tiers by Intent

**Tier 1 — High Intent (convert now):**
- "[product/service] + buy/pricing/near me/cost"
- Brand keywords
- Competitor keywords (bid carefully)

**Tier 2 — Consideration (educate + convert):**
- "Best [product category]"
- "[Product] vs [competitor]"
- "[Problem] solution/tool/software"

**Tier 3 — Awareness (top of funnel):**
- Informational queries about the problem
- "How to [solve problem]"
- Generally lower ROI for direct conversion; better for display/YouTube

### Negative Keywords
Critical for preventing wasted spend. Build negative lists for:
- Irrelevant industries using the same terms
- Free/DIY intent ("free", "open source", "tutorial", "how to" — if not intent-matched)
- Wrong-tier roles or company sizes
- Competitor brand names (unless specifically bidding on them)

## Google Ads Copywriting

### Responsive Search Ads (RSA) Structure
- **Headlines:** 15 available (Google shows 3 at a time), 30 characters each
- **Descriptions:** 4 available (Google shows 2), 90 characters each
- **Approach:** Load all 15 headlines; Google tests combinations

**Headline formula (mix these):**
1. Primary keyword in headline
2. Key benefit (what they get)
3. Differentiator (why you're different)
4. Offer / CTA ("Get Free Quote", "Start Free Trial")
5. Social proof ("Trusted by 10,000+ Teams")
6. Urgency / scarcity ("Limited Spots Available")

### Quality Score Components
1. **Expected CTR** — Will searchers click this ad?
2. **Ad relevance** — Does the ad match the search intent?
3. **Landing page experience** — Does the LP deliver on the ad's promise?

Higher Quality Score = Lower CPCs + Better ad position. Aim for 7-10 on priority keywords.

### Ad Copy Principles
- Mirror the keyword in headline 1
- Highlight the unique benefit (not features — benefits)
- Include a clear CTA in every ad
- Test emotional vs. rational appeals
- Use ad extensions to take up more SERP real estate

## Ad Extensions (Assets)

Use all relevant extensions:
- **Sitelinks:** Link to other relevant pages (pricing, features, case studies)
- **Callouts:** Highlight benefits ("No credit card required", "24/7 support")
- **Structured snippets:** List features or service types
- **Call extension:** Phone number for service businesses
- **Lead form extension:** Capture leads directly from SERP
- **Price extension:** Show pricing tiers
- **Promotion extension:** Highlight offers

## Bidding Strategy

| Strategy | Use When |
|---|---|
| Manual CPC | Starting out — control costs, learn what works |
| Enhanced CPC | Semi-automated; good transitional strategy |
| Target CPA | Have 30+ conversions/month; know your target CPA |
| Target ROAS | Have 50+ conversions/month; e-commerce |
| Maximize Conversions | Want Google to spend budget efficiently (needs conversion data) |
| Maximize Clicks | Top of funnel / awareness campaigns |

## Budget Allocation Framework

- **Phase 1 (0-30 days):** Test with manual CPC; learn keyword performance
- **Phase 2 (30-90 days):** Shift winners to Smart Bidding; cut losers
- **Phase 3 (90+ days):** Scale winners; explore new keyword tiers

**Budget split:**
- 60-70% on proven, converting campaigns
- 20-30% on testing new keywords / ad variations
- 10% on competitive intelligence campaigns

## Landing Page Requirements

Search ads perform best when landing pages:
- Match headline/message exactly (message match)
- Load in under 3 seconds
- Have one primary CTA above the fold
- Include relevant social proof (logo wall, testimonials, G2 rating)
- No navigation links (removes exit paths)

## Campaign Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| CTR | Clicks / Impressions | > 3-5% for search |
| Quality Score | 1-10 relevance score | 7+ for priority keywords |
| CPC | Cost per click | Depends on industry |
| Conversion rate | Conversions / clicks | Depends on offer |
| CPA | Cost per acquisition | Must be below LTV |
| ROAS | Revenue / ad spend | 3x+ (e-commerce) |
| Impression share | % of available impressions won | > 60% for brand terms |

## Common Mistakes

- Sending all traffic to the homepage (kills conversion rates)
- Using only broad match keywords without Smart Bidding data
- Not building out negative keyword lists
- Setting it and forgetting it — SEM requires active management
- Measuring only clicks, not pipeline or revenue contribution
