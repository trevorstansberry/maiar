# Conversational Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Conversational marketing replaces forms with conversations. Instead of making a potential customer fill out a form and wait, you engage them in real-time dialogue — qualifying, educating, and routing them to the right outcome in the moment.

**The core insight:** B2B buyers expect B2C-speed experiences. A qualified prospect won't wait 24 hours for a response on a pricing inquiry.

## Conversational Channels

### Website Chat (Chatbot + Live)

**What it replaces:**
- Long contact forms
- "We'll be in touch" delays
- Generic email nurtures for high-intent visitors

**Use cases:**
- Qualify inbound leads in real-time
- Book meetings directly from high-intent pages (pricing, demo request)
- Answer FAQs without requiring a form
- Route to the right sales person based on segment
- Support existing customers

**Bot vs. live agent:**
- **Bot (24/7):** FAQ, lead qualification, meeting booking, after-hours coverage
- **Live agent:** Complex questions, high-value prospects, late-stage conversations

**Platforms:** Drift, Intercom, HubSpot Live Chat, Qualified (for B2B), Tidio (SMB)

### Conversation Design Principles

**Good chatbot flows:**
1. Greet based on page context (pricing page visitor vs. blog visitor)
2. Ask one qualifying question at a time (not a form disguised as a chat)
3. Offer immediate value before asking anything
4. Always offer a human escalation path
5. Short, conversational messages — not marketing paragraphs
6. Clear decision branches with defined outcomes (book meeting / send resource / route to sales)

**Chatbot script structure:**
```
Bot: "Hey! Are you exploring [Product] for the first time, or looking for help with something specific?"
→ Option A: "First time" → Qualification flow
→ Option B: "Help with something" → Support flow
```

### SMS Marketing

SMS is the highest open-rate channel (98%) but carries the highest risk of abuse — people guard their phone numbers closely.

**SMS best practices:**
- Only send to people who explicitly opted in to SMS (not just email)
- Maximum 2-4 messages/month for most brands
- Message must be immediately relevant and valuable
- Always include opt-out path ("Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
- Personalize: include name + context when possible
- Send at appropriate times (10am-8pm local; never weekends unless warranted)

**High-performing SMS use cases:**
- Transactional: Order confirmation, shipping updates, appointment reminders
- Time-sensitive promotions: Flash sale, event reminder (24-hour window)
- Re-engagement: "We noticed you haven't logged in — your [thing] is ready"
- Abandoned cart: Short, direct reminder with direct link

**Platforms:** Attentive, Klaviyo (SMS), Postscript (e-commerce), SimpleTexting, Twilio (custom)

### Conversational Email

Email can be conversational even when it's not live:
- Use first person, plain text style (not designed HTML templates)
- Reply-worthy subject lines: questions, direct statements, curiosity
- Ask one question per email; invite a reply
- Segment by behavior and respond to replies with human responses
- "Just reply to this email" as CTA — reduces friction vs. form

## Lead Qualification Frameworks in Conversation

### BANT (traditional, useful for context)
- **Budget:** Do they have budget authority?
- **Authority:** Are they the decision-maker?
- **Need:** Do they have the problem your product solves?
- **Timeline:** When are they looking to solve it?

### MEDDIC (deeper, enterprise-focused)
- **Metrics:** What quantified outcome matters to them?
- **Economic Buyer:** Who controls the budget?
- **Decision Criteria:** What criteria will drive their decision?
- **Decision Process:** How do they make this type of decision?
- **Identify Pain:** What's the cost of not solving this?
- **Champion:** Who internally wants this to succeed?

### Conversation-Friendly Qualification
For chat: pick 2-3 key questions that quickly sort fit from non-fit:
1. "What's your main goal with [product category]?"
2. "How many people would be using this?"
3. "When are you looking to move forward?"
