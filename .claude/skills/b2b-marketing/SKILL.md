# B2B Marketing

## Core Philosophy

B2B marketing is fundamentally about building trust with people who make risk-averse decisions with other people's money. Unlike B2C, the buyer is rarely the user, the sales cycle is long, and multiple stakeholders must be convinced.

**The B2B buyer's reality:**
- Average B2B purchase involves 6-10 decision-makers
- 67% of the buyer's journey happens before talking to sales
- Most B2B purchases are replacing something that already exists — "good enough" is your real competitor


## Expert Foundations

**Ardath Albee — Digital Relevance**
Albee's framework: B2B marketing fails because it talks to companies, not people. The buyer is a human being making a decision that will affect their career. Every piece of B2B marketing should speak to that human's aspirations, fears, and professional context — not to their company's generic "pain points."

**CEB / Gartner — The Challenger Customer**
The Challenger research finding that changed B2B: the biggest competitor in complex B2B sales is not a rival vendor — it's the status quo. Buyers who see change as too risky default to "do nothing." The marketing job is to make the cost of inaction more vivid than the cost of change. Teaching prospects something they didn't know about their own business — "insight selling" — outperforms relationship selling in enterprise B2B.

### B2B Buying Committee Reality

Average B2B purchase involves 6.8 decision-makers (Gartner). Each has a different role:
- **Economic buyer:** Signs the check. Cares about ROI and risk.
- **Champion:** Internal advocate. Cares about career impact and internal credibility.
- **End users:** Use the product daily. Care about ease of use and time savings.
- **IT / Security:** Gatekeepers. Care about technical risk and compliance.
- **Legal / Finance:** Review contracts and costs. Care about terms and total cost.

*Marketing to only one persona is why most B2B campaigns underperform. Each role needs different content.*

### B2B Content by Funnel Stage

| Stage | Buyer Question | Content That Works |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | "Do I have this problem?" | Industry reports, research, thought leadership, benchmarks |
| Consideration | "What are my options?" | Comparison guides, how-tos, product tours, webinars |
| Decision | "Why you vs. alternatives?" | Case studies (same industry, same size), ROI calculators, demos, references |
| Post-purchase | "Did I make the right call?" | Onboarding guides, success stories, customer community |

### The "Cost of Inaction" Frame

When prospects default to status quo, make inaction expensive:
- Quantify what the problem costs them (lost revenue, wasted hours, risk exposure)
- Show what competitors are doing with the category you're selling
- Make the case that the window for change is closing (market shift, competitive pressure)

This reframes the decision from "risk of change" to "risk of staying still."

### B2B vs. B2C Marketing Differences

| Dimension | B2B | B2C |
|---|---|---|
| Decision-makers | Multiple (6.8 avg) | 1-2 |
| Sales cycle | Weeks to months | Minutes to days |
| Content depth | Deep, research-backed | Emotional, visual, fast |
| Channel | LinkedIn, email, events, outbound | Social, paid, SEO, retail |
| Trust signals | Case studies, analyst validation, peers | Reviews, social proof, influencers |
| Metric | Pipeline, win rate, deal size | Conversion rate, ROAS, LTV |

## B2B vs. B2C Differences

| Dimension | B2B | B2C |
|---|---|---|
| Decision-makers | Multiple (committee) | Usually one |
| Sales cycle | Weeks to months | Minutes to days |
| Deal size | Larger | Usually smaller |
| Buying emotion | Fear of making wrong choice | Desire, FOMO |
| Content | Educational, ROI-focused | Emotional, aspirational |
| Primary channels | LinkedIn, email, events, content | Social, search, display |
| Success metric | Pipeline generated | Revenue / conversions |

## B2B Buyer Journey

### Stages and Content Mapping

**Awareness (Problem Recognition)**
- Buyer: "We have a problem but haven't defined a solution yet"
- Content: Thought leadership, research reports, podcast, articles that name the problem
- Channels: SEO, LinkedIn, word-of-mouth

**Consideration (Solution Exploration)**
- Buyer: "We're exploring categories and vendors"
- Content: Comparison guides, category overviews, webinars, case studies
- Channels: Retargeting, email nurture, search (category keywords)

**Decision (Vendor Selection)**
- Buyer: "We're choosing between 2-3 vendors"
- Content: Product demos, ROI calculators, reference calls, security/compliance docs
- Channels: SDR outreach, sales, G2/Capterra reviews, events

**Post-Purchase (Retention & Expansion)**
- Buyer: "We're evaluating if we made the right choice"
- Content: Onboarding, customer success, upsell campaigns, community
- Channels: Email, in-product, CS team

## Demand Generation Framework

### Demand Capture vs. Demand Creation

**Demand capture:** Capture buyers who are already in-market
- Keywords with commercial intent
- G2/Capterra/comparison site optimization
- Branded search
- Competitor targeting
- Bottom-of-funnel retargeting

**Demand creation:** Educate and create demand among buyers not yet looking
- Thought leadership content
- LinkedIn + social presence
- Events and webinars
- Podcast and video
- Community and community-led growth

**Most B2B companies under-invest in demand creation.** The buyers you capture today were created by someone's content 6-12 months ago.

### The Dark Funnel

Most B2B buying research happens outside your tracking:
- Private Slack communities
- Peer recommendations
- Review sites (not attributed)
- LinkedIn posts they never clicked on but remember

**Implication:** Create content and brand presence everywhere your ICP spends time, even if you can't track direct attribution.

## Multi-Stakeholder Marketing

### Stakeholder Map
In a B2B purchase, typical stakeholders include:
- **Economic Buyer:** Controls budget and final approval
- **Champion:** Internal advocate who wants your product to win
- **End User:** Person who will use the product day-to-day
- **IT/Security:** Technical evaluator
- **Procurement:** Contract and pricing negotiation
- **Legal:** Reviews terms and data processing agreements

Each stakeholder needs different content:
- Economic Buyer: ROI, risk mitigation, strategic alignment
- Champion: Make them look smart to their boss
- End User: How it makes their life easier
- IT/Security: Security documentation, SOC 2, data handling
- Procurement: Standard terms, pricing clarity

### Sales Enablement

Give sales the tools to carry the message:
- One-pagers by persona and use case
- Objection handling guides
- Competitive battlecards
- Case studies by industry / company size
- ROI calculator
- Pricing FAQ
- Technical documentation and security questionnaire responses

## LinkedIn Strategy for B2B

LinkedIn is the highest-ROI organic channel for most B2B companies.

- **Company page:** Content that builds thought leadership, not just product updates
- **Executive presence:** CEOs and leaders with strong personal brands amplify everything
- **Employee advocacy:** Train the team to share relevant content
- **LinkedIn Ads:** Most precise B2B targeting available (job title + company size + industry)
- **Content types that work:** Data + insights, personal founder stories, controversial takes, "how we do X at [Company]"

## B2B Metrics

| Stage | Metric |
|---|---|
| Awareness | Brand awareness lift, SOV (share of voice), website sessions |
| Pipeline | MQLs, SQLs, pipeline created ($), pipeline coverage ratio |
| Conversion | Opportunity → Close rate, Sales cycle length |
| Revenue | ARR, NRR, LTV, CAC, CAC payback period |
| Retention | Churn rate, expansion revenue, NPS |

## Common Mistakes

- Measuring leads instead of pipeline (not all leads are created equal)
- No content for the consideration and decision stages
- Ignoring the dark funnel (over-attributing to last-touch)
- Treating all ICP companies the same (segmentation matters)
- Marketing only to the champion, not the economic buyer
