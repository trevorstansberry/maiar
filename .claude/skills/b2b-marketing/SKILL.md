# B2B Marketing

## Core Philosophy

B2B marketing is fundamentally about building trust with people who make risk-averse decisions with other people's money. Unlike B2C, the buyer is rarely the user, the sales cycle is long, and multiple stakeholders must be convinced.

**The B2B buyer's reality:**
- Average B2B purchase involves 6-10 decision-makers
- 67% of the buyer's journey happens before talking to sales
- Most B2B purchases are replacing something that already exists — "good enough" is your real competitor

## B2B vs. B2C Differences

| Dimension | B2B | B2C |
|---|---|---|
| Decision-makers | Multiple (committee) | Usually one |
| Sales cycle | Weeks to months | Minutes to days |
| Deal size | Larger | Usually smaller |
| Buying emotion | Fear of making wrong choice | Desire, FOMO |
| Content | Educational, ROI-focused | Emotional, aspirational |
| Primary channels | LinkedIn, email, events, content | Social, search, display |
| Success metric | Pipeline generated | Revenue / conversions |

## B2B Buyer Journey

### Stages and Content Mapping

**Awareness (Problem Recognition)**
- Buyer: "We have a problem but haven't defined a solution yet"
- Content: Thought leadership, research reports, podcast, articles that name the problem
- Channels: SEO, LinkedIn, word-of-mouth

**Consideration (Solution Exploration)**
- Buyer: "We're exploring categories and vendors"
- Content: Comparison guides, category overviews, webinars, case studies
- Channels: Retargeting, email nurture, search (category keywords)

**Decision (Vendor Selection)**
- Buyer: "We're choosing between 2-3 vendors"
- Content: Product demos, ROI calculators, reference calls, security/compliance docs
- Channels: SDR outreach, sales, G2/Capterra reviews, events

**Post-Purchase (Retention & Expansion)**
- Buyer: "We're evaluating if we made the right choice"
- Content: Onboarding, customer success, upsell campaigns, community
- Channels: Email, in-product, CS team

## Demand Generation Framework

### Demand Capture vs. Demand Creation

**Demand capture:** Capture buyers who are already in-market
- Keywords with commercial intent
- G2/Capterra/comparison site optimization
- Branded search
- Competitor targeting
- Bottom-of-funnel retargeting

**Demand creation:** Educate and create demand among buyers not yet looking
- Thought leadership content
- LinkedIn + social presence
- Events and webinars
- Podcast and video
- Community and community-led growth

**Most B2B companies under-invest in demand creation.** The buyers you capture today were created by someone's content 6-12 months ago.

### The Dark Funnel

Most B2B buying research happens outside your tracking:
- Private Slack communities
- Peer recommendations
- Review sites (not attributed)
- LinkedIn posts they never clicked on but remember

**Implication:** Create content and brand presence everywhere your ICP spends time, even if you can't track direct attribution.

## Multi-Stakeholder Marketing

### Stakeholder Map
In a B2B purchase, typical stakeholders include:
- **Economic Buyer:** Controls budget and final approval
- **Champion:** Internal advocate who wants your product to win
- **End User:** Person who will use the product day-to-day
- **IT/Security:** Technical evaluator
- **Procurement:** Contract and pricing negotiation
- **Legal:** Reviews terms and data processing agreements

Each stakeholder needs different content:
- Economic Buyer: ROI, risk mitigation, strategic alignment
- Champion: Make them look smart to their boss
- End User: How it makes their life easier
- IT/Security: Security documentation, SOC 2, data handling
- Procurement: Standard terms, pricing clarity

### Sales Enablement

Give sales the tools to carry the message:
- One-pagers by persona and use case
- Objection handling guides
- Competitive battlecards
- Case studies by industry / company size
- ROI calculator
- Pricing FAQ
- Technical documentation and security questionnaire responses

## LinkedIn Strategy for B2B

LinkedIn is the highest-ROI organic channel for most B2B companies.

- **Company page:** Content that builds thought leadership, not just product updates
- **Executive presence:** CEOs and leaders with strong personal brands amplify everything
- **Employee advocacy:** Train the team to share relevant content
- **LinkedIn Ads:** Most precise B2B targeting available (job title + company size + industry)
- **Content types that work:** Data + insights, personal founder stories, controversial takes, "how we do X at [Company]"

## B2B Metrics

| Stage | Metric |
|---|---|
| Awareness | Brand awareness lift, SOV (share of voice), website sessions |
| Pipeline | MQLs, SQLs, pipeline created ($), pipeline coverage ratio |
| Conversion | Opportunity → Close rate, Sales cycle length |
| Revenue | ARR, NRR, LTV, CAC, CAC payback period |
| Retention | Churn rate, expansion revenue, NPS |

## Common Mistakes

- Measuring leads instead of pipeline (not all leads are created equal)
- No content for the consideration and decision stages
- Ignoring the dark funnel (over-attributing to last-touch)
- Treating all ICP companies the same (segmentation matters)
- Marketing only to the champion, not the economic buyer
