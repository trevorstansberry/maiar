# Community Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**David Spinks — The Business of Belonging**
Spinks's framework: communities exist to fulfill a shared purpose, not to serve a brand's marketing goals. The three stages of community growth: discovery (people find the community), habit formation (they return regularly), and belonging (they identify with the community). Communities fail when brands treat members as an audience rather than participants.

**Rosie Sherry — Community-Led Growth**
The CLG framework: community isn't a marketing channel — it's a business strategy. Community creates compounding returns: members help each other (reducing CS costs), create content (reducing marketing costs), and become advocates (reducing CAC). Measure community ROI through retention improvement, support deflection, and referral rate, not engagement metrics alone.


Community is the ultimate competitive moat. A strong brand community creates belonging — customers who don't just use your product but identify with it, advocate for it, and bring others in. Communities are hard to copy because they're made of relationships, not features.

**Community vs. audience:** An audience is passive (they consume what you create). A community is active (members create value for each other). The goal is to transition from audience to community.

## Community Models

| Model | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Customer community | Space for customers to connect, learn, and help each other | SaaS, complex products, B2B |
| Practice community | Community of practitioners in a field (not limited to your customers) | Thought leadership, ecosystem building |
| Creator / contributor | Community that creates content or contributions (OSS, templates, etc.) | Developer tools, PLG products |
| Brand advocacy community | Your most loyal fans with exclusive access and recognition | B2C, lifestyle brands |
| Events community | Built around recurring events (meetups, conferences) | Local/industry brands |

## Community Platform Selection

| Platform | Best For |
|---|---|
| Slack | Async text, tech/SaaS communities, < 5,000 members |
| Discord | Gaming, creator, developer communities; more structured channels |
| Circle | White-label community with courses + events; modern CMX alternative |
| Discourse | Forum-style, searchable; strong for support + knowledge base |
| Facebook Groups | B2C, local, older demographics; free but algorithmically controlled |
| LinkedIn Events + Newsletter | Professional, B2B; low commitment for audience |
| Beehiiv / Substack | Newsletter-first community; strong for content creators |

**Platform decision:** Go where your members already are. If your ICP is all in Slack, build there. Don't ask them to adopt a new tool.

## Community Building Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation (0-100 members)
- Define the community's purpose and who it's for with extreme specificity
- Recruit founding members personally — the first 20 people set the culture
- Create the initial content, questions, and discussions yourself
- Establish norms and moderation rules early
- Make early members feel like co-owners, not customers

### Stage 2: Growth (100-1,000 members)
- Identify and empower "super members" who show up consistently
- Create regular programming: AMAs, weekly threads, member spotlights
- Reduce friction to joining (clear onboarding, quick wins)
- Bridge online and offline (events, meetups)

### Stage 3: Scale (1,000+ members)
- Community management team or program manager
- Formal ambassador / moderator program
- Structured subgroups or channels by interest/role
- Automated onboarding and engagement flows
- Data and reporting on community health

## Community Programming

### Regular Programming Ideas
- **Weekly:** Discussion thread prompt (e.g., "What's your biggest challenge this week?")
- **Monthly:** AMA with a relevant expert, team member, or customer
- **Monthly:** Member spotlight (feature a member's story or win)
- **Quarterly:** Community report (top discussions, wins, growth stats)
- **Annually:** Member survey + state of the community post

### Events
- Virtual office hours or help sessions
- Product roadmap previews / feedback sessions
- Peer-to-peer learning sessions (members teach members)
- Annual or semi-annual in-person gathering (for strong communities)

## Moderation & Culture

Community culture is set by what you allow, reward, and remove.

**Allow and reward:**
- Genuine questions and helpful answers
- Vulnerability and sharing struggles (not just wins)
- Constructive criticism of your product
- Recognition and celebration of members

**Actively manage:**
- Spam and self-promotion (clarify rules upfront)
- Negativity and hostility
- Off-topic tangents that clutter value
- Inactivity (ghost accounts dilute the community feel)

## Community-Led Growth

Communities can drive business growth when:
1. Members answer each other's questions → reduces support costs
2. Member success stories → case studies and social proof
3. Members invite others → organic acquisition
4. Community activity → product feedback and innovation
5. Community exclusivity → retention and loyalty

**Metrics that connect community to business:**
- Community members' churn rate vs. non-members (usually 2-5× lower)
- Product adoption rates in community vs. non-community customers
- Referral rates from community members

## Community Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Member count | Size |
| Active members (monthly) | Engagement health (target 20-30% of total) |
| Daily active members | High engagement signal |
| Posts / discussions per week | Content vitality |
| Response rate to questions | Community helpfulness |
| New member activation rate | % who post in first 30 days |
| Community NPS | Member satisfaction |
| Referral rate from members | Business impact |
