description: "Use when optimizing paid marketing for measurable ROI, building attribution models, managing CAC and LTV, planning channel mix, or scaling paid acquisition. Also use when the user says "performance marketing", "marketing ROI", "CAC too high", "LTV:CAC ratio", "channel attribution", "marketing efficiency", "scale paid acquisition", "incrementality testing", or "marketing spend optimization". Applies Perry Marshall's profit maximization model and Andrew Chen's unit economics framework."

# Performance Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**Perry Marshall — The 80/20 of Marketing**
80% of your results come from 20% of your marketing spend. Within that 20%, another 80/20 applies. The discipline of performance marketing is identifying and concentrating on the small number of campaigns, keywords, and audiences that generate the majority of profitable outcomes — then ruthlessly cutting everything else.

**Andrew Chen — Unit Economics and Growth**
The three laws of performance marketing: (1) Every channel eventually saturates — CAC rises as you exhaust the best audiences. (2) The channels that scale biggest are the ones with the largest total addressable audience. (3) Retention determines whether performance marketing works — if customers churn before you recoup CAC, the channel destroys value regardless of ROAS.


Performance marketing is marketing where every dollar spent is tied to a measurable outcome. The goal isn't just to acquire customers — it's to acquire the right customers at a cost that makes the business model work.

**The performance marketing equation:**
LTV > CAC × (CAC payback period tolerance)

If LTV > 3× CAC, you generally have a scalable acquisition engine. Below 3×, fix the economics before scaling.

## Core Metrics Framework

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| CAC | Total acquisition cost / New customers | < 1/3 of LTV |
| LTV | ARPU × Gross margin × Average customer lifespan | > 3× CAC |
| LTV:CAC ratio | LTV / CAC | 3:1 minimum; 5:1 is excellent |
| CAC payback period | CAC / (ARPU × Gross margin) | < 12 months (SaaS), < 6 months (e-comm) |
| ROAS | Revenue / Ad spend | 3x+ (e-commerce); varies by model |
| MER | Total revenue / Total ad spend | Holistic efficiency measure |

### Why MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) Matters

Attribution is broken — iOS14+, cookie deprecation, and dark social mean last-click attribution misattributes 30-50% of conversions. MER (total revenue ÷ total ad spend) is a more reliable measure of overall marketing efficiency, even if it sacrifices channel-level precision.

## Channel Attribution

### Attribution Models

| Model | Logic | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Last-click | 100% credit to last touchpoint | Overstates bottom-funnel; ignores awareness |
| First-click | 100% credit to first touchpoint | Ignores everything that helped close |
| Linear | Equal credit to all touchpoints | Doesn't reflect real influence |
| Time decay | More credit to recent touches | Still undervalues awareness |
| Data-driven | Algorithmic (Google's model) | Black box; needs volume |
| Mixed/Blended | Human judgment + data | Most honest approach |

**Recommended approach:** Use blended attribution + incrementality testing for important spend decisions.

### Incrementality Testing

The only way to truly measure a channel's contribution:
1. Hold out test: Stop running ads in a geography or audience segment
2. Measure difference in conversion rate vs. exposed segment
3. The lift is the true incremental contribution of the channel

Run these quarterly for major channels.

## Channel Mix Strategy

### Full-Funnel Channel Map

| Funnel Stage | Goal | Channels |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | Reach ICP | LinkedIn, YouTube, Meta, podcast ads, OOH |
| Consideration | Educate, build intent | Content/SEO, retargeting, email nurture |
| Decision | Convert | Google Search (branded/BOFU), direct, sales |
| Retention | Reduce churn | Email, in-product, CS |
| Expansion | Upsell/cross-sell | Email, in-product, sales |

### Budget Allocation Framework

**Starting allocation (adjust based on data):**
- 50% demand capture (Google search, branded, BOFU retargeting)
- 30% demand creation (LinkedIn, Meta, YouTube — upper funnel)
- 20% retention/expansion (email, in-product)

**Scaling rule:** Only scale a channel once it's profitable at current spend. Don't add budget to fix an efficiency problem.

### Channel Maturity Stages

| Stage | Approach |
|---|---|
| Testing | Small budget, learn what works, measure CPA |
| Optimizing | Scale what works, cut what doesn't, A/B testing |
| Scaling | Increase budget 20-30% weekly as long as efficiency holds |
| Diversifying | Add new channels before existing channels plateau |

## Creative Testing Framework

Creative is the largest lever in paid performance (especially Meta/social).

**Testing cadence:**
- Test 3-5 new creative concepts per month per channel
- Isolate variables: test one thing at a time (hook vs. hook, not hook + format + offer)
- Statistical significance: need 100+ conversions per variant before declaring winner
- Kill losers fast (< 100 impressions if CTR is terrible); let winners run

**Creative elements to test:**
1. Hook (first 3 seconds of video, headline of image/text)
2. Format (video vs. static vs. carousel vs. UGC)
3. Offer (free trial vs. demo vs. discount)
4. Social proof type (customer quote vs. review rating vs. case study stat)
5. Audience angle (pain-led vs. aspiration-led vs. social proof-led)

## Landing Page Optimization for Performance

Paid traffic conversion depends on:
1. **Message match:** Ad promise = landing page headline
2. **Load speed:** Under 2 seconds on mobile
3. **Single CTA:** Remove navigation; focus attention on one action
4. **Social proof above fold:** Logo wall, review stars, testimonial
5. **Mobile optimization:** 60-70% of paid traffic is mobile

Run CRO tests in parallel with ad tests. A 20% improvement in conversion rate doubles the return from the same ad spend.

## Scaling Paid Channels

### Horizontal Scaling
- Add new audiences (lookalikes, interest, in-market)
- Add new creatives (new hooks, angles, formats)
- Add new placements (Stories, Reels, Audience Network)

### Vertical Scaling
- Increase budget on winning campaigns (20-30%/week max to avoid auction disruption)
- Duplicate winning ad sets with increased budget

### Signals You're Ready to Scale
- CAC is stable or improving as you increase spend
- ROAS is above target at current spend
- You have a conversion rate optimization hypothesis to offset scaling efficiency loss
