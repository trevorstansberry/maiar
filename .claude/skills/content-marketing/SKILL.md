# Content Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Content marketing is the practice of creating and distributing valuable content to attract, engage, and retain a defined audience — with the goal of driving profitable action. It's a long game that compounds: great content earns traffic, trust, and links for years.

**The Content Marketing Test:** Would someone seek this out if it weren't published by your brand? If no, it's marketing material, not content marketing.

## Content Strategy Foundation

### Three Questions Before Every Piece
1. Who is this for? (Specific persona, not "our audience")
2. What problem does it solve or question does it answer?
3. What is the one action we want them to take after reading?

### Content Pillars
Build 2-4 content pillars aligned to:
- Your ICP's biggest challenges and goals
- Topics where you have genuine expertise or unique perspective
- Intersections of your audience's interests and your product's value

Example: A project management SaaS might own pillars around "remote team productivity," "agile for small teams," and "reducing meeting overload."

## Content Architecture

### Pillar + Cluster Model
- **Pillar page:** Comprehensive guide (2,500-5,000 words) on a broad topic your ICP cares about
- **Cluster content:** 8-15 supporting posts that go deep on subtopics, each linking back to the pillar
- **Benefit:** Builds topical authority for search, creates internal linking structure, gives readers a clear path deeper

### Content Funnel Mapping

| Funnel Stage | Content Goal | Content Types |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness (TOFU) | Build audience, earn trust | How-to guides, tutorials, research, thought leadership, explainers |
| Consideration (MOFU) | Educate on solutions | Comparisons, case studies, deep dives, webinars, product guides |
| Decision (BOFU) | Convert to customer | Demos, free trials, ROI calculators, customer stories, audits |

## Editorial Calendar

### Planning Cadence
- **Monthly:** Review what's in progress, assign new pieces
- **Quarterly:** Review performance, identify gaps, plan pillar/cluster work
- **Annually:** Content audit, pillar strategy refresh

### Content Calendar Fields
- Title / working title
- Funnel stage
- Target keyword(s) + search volume
- Target persona
- Content type and format
- Assigned writer
- Publish date
- Distribution channels
- CTA / conversion goal

### Publishing Frequency Benchmarks
- 1 post/week: solid baseline for SEO and audience growth
- 2-4 posts/week: accelerated growth phase
- Daily: only if you have the quality and distribution system to support it

## Content Formats

| Format | Best For | Avg. Production Time |
|---|---|---|
| Long-form guide (2,000+ words) | SEO, thought leadership | 4-8 hours |
| List post | SEO, social sharing | 2-4 hours |
| Case study | Consideration/decision, sales enablement | 4-6 hours |
| Original research | Authority, backlinks, PR | 40-80+ hours |
| Infographic | Social sharing, complex data visualization | 4-8 hours |
| Video / explainer | Awareness, product education | Varies widely |
| Podcast episode | Community, thought leadership | 2-4 hours + editing |
| Newsletter | Retention, direct audience relationship | 1-3 hours |
| Template / tool | Leads, backlinks, value delivery | 4-20 hours |

## Content Repurposing System

One piece of pillar content → 10+ pieces of content:
1. Long-form blog post
2. 3-5 LinkedIn posts (one insight each)
3. Twitter/X thread
4. Email newsletter summary
5. Short-form video (key takeaway)
6. Infographic
7. Podcast episode or audio version
8. Slide deck (for LinkedIn or SlideShare)
9. Quote cards for Instagram
10. Webinar or live session

## Content Distribution

**The 80/20 rule:** Spend 20% of your time creating content, 80% distributing it.

Distribution channels by priority:
1. Email list (owned, highest conversion)
2. SEO (compounds over time)
3. Social media (amplifies reach)
4. Community sharing (relevant Slack/Discord/Reddit/forums)
5. Guest posting / content partnerships
6. Paid promotion for high-performing content

## Content Performance Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Organic traffic | SEO traction |
| Time on page | Engagement quality |
| Scroll depth | Content consumption |
| Backlinks earned | Authority building |
| Email opt-ins from content | Lead generation |
| Content → pipeline contribution | Business impact |
| Social shares | Distribution reach |

## Content Audit Framework

Run quarterly for existing content:
1. **Traffic:** Sort by sessions — identify top performers and underperformers
2. **Conversion:** Which posts drive email signups, demos, or purchases?
3. **Action:** Keep (top performers), update (declining but valuable), merge (thin content), cut (no traffic, no links, no value)

## Common Mistakes

- Publishing without distribution plans
- Creating content for search engines, not humans
- No consistent POV or editorial voice — reads like anyone could have written it
- Skipping the content audit — old content often outperforms new
- No clear CTA on high-traffic posts
