# Outbound Marketing

## Core Philosophy

## Expert Foundations

**Aaron Ross — Predictable Revenue**
Ross's framework separated Cold Calling 2.0 from traditional outbound: never cold call, send email first to find the right person, use specialized roles (SDRs for prospecting, AEs for closing), and build a repeatable outbound system. The key insight: outbound should generate *predictable* pipeline, not random luck.

**Josh Braun — Spear Prospecting**
Braun's approach: stop interrupting and start being interesting. The Spear framework — Situation, Problem, Effect, Action, Role — structures outbound messages around the prospect's world, not your product. The best outbound opens with "I noticed..." followed by a trigger that shows genuine research.


Outbound means going to your audience rather than waiting for them to come to you. Done right, it targets the right people with the right message at the right time. Done wrong, it annoys everyone and burns your domain reputation.

**The only question that matters:** Is this person a genuinely good fit, and is my message relevant to their current situation?

## Outbound Channels

### Cold Email
**What works:**
- Hyper-personalized, short (under 100 words), one CTA
- Research the prospect before writing — reference something specific
- Subject line < 40 characters, no spam trigger words
- Send from a warmed domain (never your main domain for high-volume)

**Sequence structure (5-touch):**
1. Email 1 (Day 0): Personal intro + one specific pain point + one-line CTA
2. Email 2 (Day 3): Different angle — share a relevant case study or insight
3. Email 3 (Day 7): Social proof or result-focused ask
4. Email 4 (Day 14): Break-up / "last touch" — often highest response rate
5. Email 5 (Day 21): Re-engage with new offer (free audit, resource, etc.)

**Deliverability rules:**
- Warm sending domain for 4+ weeks before cold campaigns
- Max 50-100 emails/day per inbox when starting out
- SPF, DKIM, DMARC records configured
- Reply rate below 0.3% unsubscribes = healthy

### LinkedIn Outreach
**What works:**
- Connect request with NO pitch — just a genuine connection note
- After connection: lead with value (insight, congratulations, relevant content)
- Ask for a conversation, not a sale — "Would it be worth a 15-minute call?"
- Use Sales Navigator for precise targeting (title + company size + industry)

**Sequence structure:**
1. Connection request (no pitch)
2. Day 2-3: Value message (insight or relevant content)
3. Day 7-10: Soft ask or question about their situation
4. Day 14: Final follow-up — offer something free (audit, resource, intro)

### Phone / Direct Outreach
- Research the prospect's LinkedIn, recent news, and company website before calling
- Call purpose: start a conversation, not close a deal
- Leave voicemails that reference something specific to increase callback rate
- Multi-touch: combine calls + email + LinkedIn for best results

## Outbound Targeting

### Ideal Prospect Criteria
Build a scoring matrix against:
- Company fit (size, industry, tech stack, revenue, geography)
- Role fit (title, seniority, decision-making authority)
- Timing signals (hiring for X role, funding announcement, new leadership, product launch, expansion)
- Intent signals (visited pricing page, downloaded content, searched for your category)

### List Building
- Sources: Apollo.io, Clay, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Clearbit
- Clean lists: verify emails before sending (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce)
- Segment lists: never send same message to different segments

## Message Frameworks

### AIDA for Cold Outreach
- **Attention:** Specific, relevant hook (not generic praise)
- **Interest:** One sentence on why this matters to them
- **Desire:** One sentence on the outcome you deliver
- **Action:** One clear, low-friction ask

### PAS for Pain-Led Outreach
- **Problem:** Name their specific pain
- **Agitate:** Quantify the cost of inaction
- **Solution:** Position your offering as the path forward

### The "Trigger" Framework (most effective)
1. Identify a trigger event (funding, hiring, expansion, new product)
2. Tie your message directly to that trigger
3. Show relevance: "I noticed you're hiring 10 SDRs — we help companies like yours ramp SDRs 40% faster"
4. One CTA

## Outbound Metrics

| Metric | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Cold email open rate | 35-50% (with good subject lines) |
| Reply rate | 3-8% |
| Positive reply rate | 1-3% |
| LinkedIn connection acceptance | 20-35% |
| LinkedIn reply rate (post-connect) | 15-25% |
| Meeting booked rate | 0.5-2% of total prospects contacted |

## Common Mistakes

- Pitching in the first message
- Generic messages that could go to anyone
- Sending from your main domain without warming
- Following up more than 5 times without a new angle
- Measuring open rates as success (reply rates and meetings matter)
