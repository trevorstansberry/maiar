# Influencer Marketing

## Core Philosophy

Influencer marketing works because trust is transferable. When a creator with genuine credibility with your audience endorses your product, they borrow their relationship with followers and lend it to your brand. The key word is "genuine" — audiences can detect inauthenticity immediately.

**The golden rule:** Find influencers who would genuinely use your product even without being paid.

## Influencer Tiers

| Tier | Followers | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nano (1K-10K) | 1K-10K | Highest engagement (5-10%), lowest cost, very niche | Limited reach |
| Micro (10K-100K) | 10K-100K | High engagement (2-5%), strong trust, niche authority | Moderate reach |
| Mid-tier (100K-500K) | 100K-500K | Balance of reach + engagement (1-3%) | Higher cost |
| Macro (500K-1M) | 500K-1M | Significant reach, credibility | Lower engagement (0.5-1.5%), expensive |
| Mega / Celebrity (1M+) | 1M+ | Massive reach, brand awareness | Very expensive, lower engagement, riskier brand alignment |

**For most brands:** Start with nano and micro — they convert better, cost less, and their audiences are more targeted.

## Influencer Identification

### Where to Find Influencers
- Native search: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X + relevant hashtags
- Platforms: Aspire, Creator.co, Grin, Upfluence, Modash, IZEA
- Your own audience: Look at who already follows and tags you
- Competitor analysis: Who promotes your competitors?

### Vetting Criteria
- **Audience authenticity:** Check follower growth curve (sudden spikes = bought followers). Use HypeAuditor or Modash.
- **Engagement quality:** Real comments (not emoji-only) that show the audience actually engages
- **Audience demographics:** Does their audience match your ICP? (Age, location, interests)
- **Content quality:** Would you be proud to have your brand featured here?
- **Brand alignment:** Do their values and aesthetics fit your brand?
- **Past partnerships:** Have they worked with direct competitors?

### Red Flags
- Engagement rate under 1% for micro accounts
- Comments that look like bots ("🔥🔥🔥", "great post!")
- Follower-to-engagement mismatch
- History of promoting anything and everything
- No clear niche or audience identity

## Outreach & Negotiation

### Initial Outreach Template
Keep it short, specific, and genuine:

> Hi [Name], I've been following your content on [topic] for a while — especially [specific recent post]. We're building [brand description] and think there's a natural fit with your audience. Would you be open to a quick conversation about a partnership?

### Compensation Models
| Model | Best For |
|---|---|
| Gifted product only | Nano, new brand partnerships |
| Gifted + commission (affiliate) | Micro, product fit is strong |
| Flat fee + gifted | Mid-tier, campaign-specific |
| Flat fee | Macro, celebrity |
| Flat fee + performance bonus | Any tier — aligns incentives |

### Rate Benchmarks (rough)
- Instagram post: $100-500 (nano), $500-5K (micro), $5K-25K (mid), $25K+ (macro)
- TikTok video: $200-1K (nano), $1K-10K (micro), $10K-50K (mid)
- YouTube dedicated video: 2-5x Instagram rates
- Always negotiate; first offers are rarely final

## Campaign Brief

Always provide a creative brief. A good brief enables creative freedom within clear guardrails.

**Brief elements:**
1. **Brand overview:** 2-3 sentences on who you are and who you serve
2. **Campaign goal:** What are we trying to achieve? (Awareness / traffic / sales / signups)
3. **Key message:** The one thing we want the audience to know or feel
4. **Mandatory inclusions:** Discount code, link, hashtag, brand mention style
5. **Tone guidance:** Examples of content we love and content that doesn't fit
6. **What NOT to do:** Any restrictions (competitor mentions, claims not to make)
7. **Deliverables:** What exactly is being created (1 Reel + 2 Stories, etc.)
8. **Timeline:** Content due date, posting window, revision rounds
9. **Approval process:** How review works before posting

**Critical:** Don't over-script. The best-performing influencer content sounds like the creator, not a brand press release.

## Campaign Execution

### Content Review Process
1. Brief sent → Creator produces draft
2. 1-2 rounds of feedback (focus on accuracy and mandatory elements, not voice)
3. Approve or send revision notes
4. Creator posts during agreed window

### Tracking Setup
- Unique discount codes per influencer (attribution)
- UTM parameters on all links
- Track both direct conversions AND halo effect (branded search volume lift, social mentions)
- Request performance metrics from creators 7-14 days post-post

## Measurement

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Reach | Total potential audience exposed |
| Impressions | Total views (can be >1 per person) |
| Engagement rate | Comments + saves + shares / reach |
| Story swipe-ups / link clicks | Direct traffic |
| Discount code redemptions | Direct conversions |
| CPM (cost per 1K impressions) | Efficiency vs. paid media |
| CPA (cost per acquisition) | Revenue efficiency |
| EMV (Earned Media Value) | Estimated value vs. paid ads |

## Long-Term Influencer Program

Scale from campaign to program:
1. Identify top performers after first campaign
2. Offer ambassador relationship (monthly or quarterly retainer)
3. Give exclusivity in your category
4. Involve them in product feedback and co-creation
5. Give them early access, special perks, and genuine insider status

Ambassadors outperform one-off partnerships because their audience sees repeated, consistent association.
